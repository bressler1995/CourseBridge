# Lesson 3: Making Open Results

## Overview

In Lesson 2 you learned how to responsibly use open results. In this lesson, we will focus on making open results. We will start by discussing what it means to make reproducible results. Having discussed the computational reproducibility practices in open software earlier in the course, in this lesson, we will specifically emphasize the importance of collaborations in making those results open and reproducible. This begins with acknowledging that scientific results are not made by single individuals. We will then teach how to ensure successful collaborations that acknowledge all contributions when making your open results. Once you have planned the rules of engagement, we will provide you with ways to ensure that your reporting and publication abide by open results principles and combat the reproducibility crisis.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:

- Identify approaches to make different types of open results.
- Recognize the importance of collaboration in making results.
- Develop contribution guidelines to enable recognition of contributors who make results.
- Combine different open results to create scientific reports and reproducible outputs.

## How to Make Open Results

### Capturing the Research Process Accurately in the Making of Results

**I am aware of the reproducibility crisis and how open science can help combat it. What practical ways can I apply to my research outputs to make open results? How can I ensure that the results I share can be reproduced by others? How can I publish scientific publications that do not add to, but combat the reproducibility crisis?**

In the Ethos of Open Science, you learned about the ethics and principles underlying responsible open science practices. In Open Code, you explored and identified the right tools and methods that ensure the usability and reproducibility of your analysis. In Open Data, you developed a data management plan that can ensure the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) of your data throughout the research process, and not just at the end when the final report from the project is released. These open science approaches directly address the root causes of the reproducibility crisis, such as: a lack of transparency throughout the scientific process, lack of documentation, poor description of intermediate methods, or missing data used at intermediate stages of the research process. In this lesson, you will learn to put all of these together to ensure that you are prepared to make your open results easy to reproduce by others.

In Lesson 1, we identified different research components that can be considered open results at various stages of research. In this lesson, we want to specifically explain what processes are involved in making them.

### Case Study: Open Results from Distributed Multi-Team Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC)

<Definitions>
  <Definition title='Example: Capturing results on activities ranging from collaboration to observations, image generation to interpretation.'>
    <p>In 2017, the Event Horizon Telescope targeted supermassive black holes with the largest apparent event horizons: M87, and Sgr A* in the Galactic Center on four separate days. This distributed collaboration led to the multi-petabyte yield of data that allowed astronomers to unveil the first image of a black hole providing the strongest visual evidence of their existence. The <a href="https://eventhorizontelescope.org/">EHTC website</a> (external link) provides information about research projects, scientific methods, instruments, press and media resources (such as blog posts, news articles and YouTube videos), as well as events, data, proposals and publications. This project shows large-scale and high-impact work that applies open practices in making their results. Different kinds of outputs shared under this project can be mapped to different stages of the research process and the teams involved in creating them.</p>
  </Definition>
</Definitions>

### Making Results and Crediting Contributors at Different Stages of Research

The case studies listed above show that results associated with a project are more than a publication. By understanding how open results are created in different projects, we can gain deep insights into the processes for making them. With that goal, the rest of this lesson describes the process of making results into three parts: 1) making all types of research outputs; 2) recognizing all contributors; and 3) combining outputs for scientific reporting and publications.

### Making All Types of Research Outputs

New ways of working with creative approaches for collaboration and communication in research have opened up opportunities to engage with the broader research communities by sharing scientific outcomes as they develop, rather than at the end through summary articles. A range of research components are created throughout the research lifecycle that can be shared openly. For example, resources created in a scientific project include, but are not limited to, the following:

<CustomTabs>
    <Tab eventKey="one" title="IDEATION AND PLANNING">

You have already come across some of these in the previous lessons, and hopefully, you can already identify which of these or additional outputs you are generating in your work. To make them part of your open results, it's important that they are shared openly with appropriate licensing and documentation so that others can read, investigate, and reuse or build upon them when possible.

### Making Open and Reproducible Results

Open science ultimately informs our decisions as scientists and guides the selection of approaches that contribute to making our results open at different stages. One of the main purposes of open results is to ensure research reproducibility, often explained through definitions such as the following:

<QuoteImage quote="Reproducibility is a researcher's ability to obtain the same results in a published article using the raw data and code used in the original study. (Stodden, 2015)" bgImage="./images/clone/Module_5/stoddenquote.jpg" byWho="Stodden, 2015" caption={<span>Image credit: "Person using a Pipette" by Edward Jenner via <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a> (external link)</span>} captionLink="https://www.pexels.com/" captionExternal={true}/>

Using this definition, results that can be computationally reproduced by others would be called "reproducible results." The EHTC case studies present open results as collections of research products created at different stages of the research process. They also provide documentation and resources that allow re-analysis and reproduction of the original results.

Ideally, anyone, anywhere, must be able to read a publication and understand the results, easily find methods applied, as well as properly follow procedures to achieve the same results as shared in that study. However, as already learned, the issue of reproducibility is prevalent across all scientific fields. A 2016 _Nature_ study found that 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce results from another scientist's work, and half have failed to reproduce their own work. (Baker, 2016) A well-intentioned scientist may share all research products and describe all steps applied in their research, but failing to provide the research environment or other technical setup they used for analyzing their data can prohibit others from reproducing their results. According to a paper published in _BioScience_, this issue is further compounded by human bias and errors. For example, individuals may not always be able to identify how their interests and experiences inform their decisions that impact their research conclusions. This makes the issue of combating the reproducibility crisis even bigger. (Elliott et al., 2014 )

Approaches for making open results should integrate reproducible tools and methods such as version control, continuous integration, containerization, code review, code testing, and documentation. Furthermore, to extend the reproducibility beyond computational aspects of research, reporting, and documentation for different types of outputs and decisions should also be supplied transparently.

### How to Make Different Types of Open Results

Sharing different types of results as early as possible not only helps you find solutions faster, but also helps your science be more reproducible since that openness will help you communicate your methodologies and your findings more clearly to others. Here we provide some easy places to start creating your results openly.

<CustomTabs>
    <Tab eventKey="one" title="WRITING A FORUM POST">
      <p>Often, when first starting in research, public forums are a great place to begin understanding and collaborating with scientific communities. Most discussion forums have a code of conduct and guidelines on best practices for participation. Some common ones that may be helpful are guidelines from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/discussions-guidelines">StackOverflow</a> (external link) and <a href="https://github.com/pydata/xarray/discussions/5404">Xarray</a> (external link), but most forums have some specific guidance. On forums, you increase trust by interacting with the scientific community, so the more you interact, the more people are likely to respond! Often, best practices include making sure you are posting to the right area, using tags (when available), and including examples that document the question or issue you are having. If you review this <a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/trick-for-improving-kerchunk-performance-for-large-numbers-of-chunks-files/3090">sample post</a> (external link) on the <a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/">Pangeo Discourse Forum</a> (external link) you can see that the author clearly states the problem they are trying to solve, references other posts on similar topics, links to a computational notebook that has an example of their code, and gives an example of the code they are trying to do.</p>
    </Tab>
    <Tab eventKey="two" title="WRITING A GOOD BLOG POST">
      <p>Blogs are long-form articles that aren't peer-reviewed. Blogs can be a great way to share your scientific process and findings before they are published, but they can also provide another presentation of the material even after they are published. For example, maybe you write a scientific article on your research that is highly technical, but then break it down in a more understandable language in a blog post. Many scientists use blog posts to develop and test ideas and approaches because they are more interactive. There are science blogs all over the internet. Some popular ones are <a href="https://medium.com/tag/science"><i>Medium</i></a> (external link), <a href="https://sciencebites.org/sciencebites-sites-galaxy/"><i>Science Bites</i></a> (external link), and <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/"><i>Scientific American</i></a> (external link). One good way to get started is to find a blog post that you like or find inspirational and use it as a guide for writing your own post.</p>
    </Tab>
    <Tab eventKey="three" title="MAKING A GOOD VIDEO">
      <p>Start small! Record a short video where you show how to do something that you struggled with or a new skill or tool that you learned how to use and post it to YouTube or other popular video platforms. Great videos often explain science concepts, ideas, or experiments to a target audience. Videos can inspire others to work in science, so talk about how you got into science, and show some of your research. There are a lot of online resources to help you out here as well!</p>
    </Tab>
    <Tab eventKey="four" title="WRITING A SOCIAL MEDIA POST">
      <p>Social media is also a good place to ask questions when you are starting on a research topic, and it can also be a place to share all types of results. Providing a link to a video, blog post, or computational notebook and/or sharing an image of a scientific result is a great way to start interactions. You can draw attention to your post by using hashtags and tagging other collaborators. There are a lot of online guides for how to write social media posts and it is always good to look at what others in your area are doing. Responding to comments and engaging with others can help you improve your research and learn about new tools or methods.</p>
    </Tab>
</CustomTabs>

All these different ways of sharing information will help make your published report or article better. And as you start working more in the open with others, think about how collaborations will work and how you will give credit. All resources can be centralized through reports and documentation on a repository or website so anyone, including the 'future you,' can find them in the future.

More ways to communicate your work can be found in The Turing Way's [Guide for Communication](https://book.the-turing-way.org/communication/communication) (external link).

### Maintaining Ethical Standards

Open science, as learned in the Ethos of Open Science, should maintain the highest ethical standards. This can be enabled through involving contributors in the development of scientific outcomes. Participatory approaches allow multiple perspectives and expertise to be integrated into research from the start and ensure that peer review happens for all outputs in an iterative manner, not just for the articles at the end.

In making and planning to share open results, you can apply the "as open as possible, as closed as necessary" principle. This means protecting sensitive information, managing data protection practices where necessary, and not carelessly sharing sensitive data or people's private information. Online repositories, such as GitHub and GitLab, allow online interaction in addition to serving the technical aspects of version control and content hosting. For example, you can use [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) (external link) and [a project board](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) (external link) to communicate what is happening in a project at any given point. The use of [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (external link) signals an invitation for peer review on the new development of code or other content. Thanks to a number of reusable templates you don't have to set up repositories from scratch. For example, you can directly use The Turing Way's [template for reproducible research projects](https://github.com/the-turing-way/reproducible-project-template) (external link).

## Role of Contributors in Open Science

Collaboration is central to all scientific research. The positive impact of collaboration is achieved when contributors are supported to combine a range of skills, perspectives, and resources together to work towards a shared goal. Projects that apply open and reproducible approaches make it easier for contributors to be involved and gain recognition for their contributions while developing beneficial solutions.

Involving and recognizing the roles of all contributors is an important part of open science, which we will discuss next.

### EHTC Case Study: Recognizing All Contributors

<SingleFigure size='medium' src="./images/clone/Module_5/image52.jpeg" caption='Image credit: "A map of the EHT. Stations active in 2017 and 2018 are shown with connecting lines and labeled in yellow, sites in commission are labeled in green, and legacy sites are labeled in red. From Paper II (Figure 1)" by The Astrophysical Journal Letters is licensed under CC-BY 4.0.'/>

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) team involved two hundred members from fifty-nine institutes in twenty countries, from undergraduates to senior members of the field. They used an array that included eight radio telescopes at six geographic locations across the United States, Latin America, Europe, and the South Pole. All collaborators were located in different geographic locations, had access to different instruments, collected data generated from telescopes in different locations, and applied skills from across different teams to create groundbreaking results. Each contributor was acknowledged across different communication channels and given authorships in publications. EHTC also supports the "critical, independent analysis and interpretation" of their published results to facilitate transparency, rigor, and reproducibility. (*Imaging Reanalyses of EHT Data,* 2022)

### Making Open Results Starts with Contributors!

Making different research components and preparing to share them as open results involve a range of activities. Behind these activities are the contributors who engage in various responsibilities that include but are not limited to:

- Conceptualizing the idea
- Designing the project
- Serving as an advisor or mentor
- Conducting experiment as a student, researcher, or research assistant
- Creating tools essential for carrying out the research
- Providing data expertise
- Developing software
- Providing specialized expertise and support
- Managing community and project requirements
- Providing feedback to the results
- Designing experiments and interpreting results
- Manuscript writing and review
- And [more](https://book.the-turing-way.org/) (external link)!

Too often conversations about contribution and authorship take place towards the end of a project or when a scientific publication is drafted. However, as you learned in the previous lessons, research outputs are generated throughout the lifetime of a research project. Therefore, it is important to build an agreement at the beginning of the project for how contributorship in the project will be managed.

Developing contribution guidelines and contributor agreements requires collaboratively defining what is considered contributions in your project, who among the current contributors will get authorship, who will get acknowledged as a contributor, the significance of the order in which authors are listed in a scientific publication, and who makes these decisions. Ensuring that all collaborators understand and agree to these guidelines before beginning the project is also important.

### Contributors and Authorship

First and foremost, you must ensure that anyone who has contributed to the research project has their contributions recognized. With that shared understanding, in this lesson, you will explore what those recognitions as contributors or authors in your research project might look like.

Let's first define contributor and author roles.

<CustomTabs>
    <Tab eventKey="one" title='A "CONTRIBUTOR"'>
      <p>A contributor is anyone who has done any activity that made it possible for the research to happen and results to be created, published or shared.</p>
    </Tab>
    <Tab eventKey="two" title='AN "AUTHOR"'>
      <p>An author of an open result is a contributor who has given a substantial contribution to the conception or design of the work or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of the data for the published work.</p>
    </Tab>
</CustomTabs>

### Are All Authors Contributors and Vice Versa?

An author is a contributor who actively carries out one or several of the tasks in the bulleted list above. All authors are contributors, but all contributors may not be authors, for example, someone serving as a mentor, trainer, or infrastructure maintainer. Ideally, all contributors are given the opportunity to author research outputs.

Given the importance traditionally placed on authorship in scientific publications and the vagueness of the definitions (that often contain relative terms such as "substantial" or "extensive," which leaves too much room for interpretation), it is not surprising that determining who among the contributors gets to be an author can lead to biased decisions, disputes between contributors, or at the very least leave someone resentful and feeling unappreciated.

There is no single approach for recognizing contributors as authors, but here is what you should consider:

<CustomTabs>
    <Tab eventKey="one" title='GROUP POWER DYNAMICS'>
      <p>Consider this hypothetical scenario: You are a postdoctoral fellow and the leading author of a research project. A rotating student spends 4 months in the lab helping you set up and perfect the experimental protocol that you will then use to carry out the experiments needed to answer your research question. They may even help you collect some preliminary data, but then they leave and later decide to join another lab. Would you provide authorship for the student?</p>
      <p>It would be unethical not to give authorship or credit to someone who has provided significant help and contributed to the success of a research, even when they are no longer involved. An appropriate pathway in this scenario could be to contact the previous contributor and involve them in writing a relevant section of the manuscript.</p>
    </Tab>
    <Tab eventKey="two" title='THE TYPE OF CONTRIBUTION'>
      <p>The NIH guidelines for authorship outline what type of contribution does or does not warrant authorship. Each contribution is represented on a sliding scale and has no rigid cutoffs. Some contributions are given more weight than others. For example, for "design and interpretation of results," and nearly all types of "original ideas, planning, and input" result in authorship. Whereas simply supervising the first author usually does not result in authorship (unless they are also contributing to the paper, of course). This is just one example. You will need to think about what this looks like for your own work!</p>
    </Tab>
</CustomTabs>

Clear communication about roles and responsibilities early in the project, and guidelines for how credit will be determined, can help mitigate some of these issues.

**Additional Resources**

The [National Institute of Health](https://oir.nih.gov/sourcebook/ethical-conduct/authorship-guidelines-resources/authorship-resources) (external link) and [ICMJE](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) (external link) both provide helpful guidance on the differences between the roles of a contributor and an author. 

### Different Roles for Contributors

It is important to set a reference for each research team/project about the different kinds of responsibilities and opportunities available for contributors and how each of them are acknowledged. [CRediT Taxonomy](https://credit.niso.org/) (external link) lists and defines roles typically played by contributors in creating scholarly output. The table below, created by open science practictioner and researcher Malvika Sharan, further breaks down researcher roles that have broad opportunities for contributorship. (Sharan, 2022) Using this as a starting point, open dialogue and discussion among team members can be facilitated to set a shared understanding and agreement about various roles of contributors, including authorship of publications. The distinction between contribution types can help set clear expectations about responsibilities and how they can be recognized in a project.

## How to Give Open Recognition

To openly and appropriately recognize all contributors, their names and the types of contributions they made should be listed in the project documentation. In manuscripts, it is a common practice to mention contributors' roles under the 'Acknowledgement' section, such as using CRedIT or similar taxonomy as provided in the table above. All contributors should be encouraged to provide ORCID iDs associated with their names to make them identifiable.

Contribution statements in documentation and manuscripts can specify who did what in the official results. This is great for transparency, and is also a great way to guard against potential power dynamics. Details about contribution type shows explicitly who works on which parts of results, and makes it easy to give proper authorship. 

<Definitions>
  <Definition title='For example:'>
    <p><em>"Pierro Asara: review and editing (equal). Kerys Jones: Conceptualization (lead); writing - original draft (lead); formal analysis (lead); writing - review and editing (equal). Elisha Roberto: Software (lead); writing - review and editing (equal). Hebei Wang: Methodology (lead); writing - review and editing (equal). Jinnie Wu: Conceptualization (supporting); Writing - original draft (supporting); Writing - review and editing (equal)."</em> (CRediT, 2025)</p>
  </Definition>
</Definitions>

If a GitHub repository and website exist, a dedicated page should be created to list and recognize all contributors. If someone minorly contributed to the paper, code or data, you could add them as an author or contributor to the GitHub and Zenodo releases respectively. Engaged collaborators and contributors not already involved in making research outputs should be given the opportunity to contribute to open results such as through presentation, posters, talks, blogs, podcasts, data, software, and articles.

### Activity 3.1: Draft a Contribution Guideline

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_5/image21.png" caption="Image credit: NASA"/>

A standalone contribution guideline should be created for each open project, even when that means reusing an existing draft that the research team has used in another project.

Note that this is different from "contributing" guidelines that describe "how" to contribute (for example on code repositories). Contribution guidelines should describe contribution types and ways to acknowledge them as discussed above.

Contribution guidelines are not set-in-stone, but rather:

- Are discipline-dependent
- Can be adapted for your unique situation

You can begin by reviewing guidelines by [NIH](https://oir.nih.gov/sourcebook/ethical-conduct/authorship-guidelines-resources/authorship-resources) (external link) and [ICMJEs](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) (external link) for authorship contributions.

Notice that many categories and criteria for authorship, such as represented in the NIH guidelines' sliding scale, may be decided differently. For example, providing financial resources for a research project always warrants authorship in some fields. In other fields this is not the case.

Some projects may not follow traditional manuscripts as their outputs. For example, if software is a primary output from a project, there may be a need to define specific roles regarding code contributions. You can work with your research team to create a version of CRediT Taxonomy for your project, such as the expanded version of the table above.

When different kinds of contributorship have been identified, clarify how different contributors will be involved and acknowledged. This may include recommended communication and collaboration processes for the team members, as well as recognition and credit for different kinds of contributions they make.

## Combining Open Results for Scientific Reporting and Publications

Scientific publications have traditionally remained one of the most popular modes of reporting and publication. Over the last decade, it has become a standard practice to submit pre-peer reviewed manuscripts on preprint servers (such as [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)) (external link) to speed access to research before the peer-reviewed journal articles are published (discussed in Lesson 2). The publication system has also evolved massively. Journal articles are no longer about writing overview and summary of research, but can be used to share articles on software, data, education materials, and more.

### EHTC Case Study: Capturing Results on Activities Ranging From Collaboration to Observations, Image Generation to Interpretation

<SingleFigure size='medium' src="./images/clone/Module_5/image53.jpeg" caption={<span>The polarized image of the M87 black hole shadow as observed on April 11, 2017 by the EHT (left panel), an image from the EHT Model Library with a MAD magnetic configuration (right panel), and a list of papers describing different sets of results.

IOPscience. <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205/page/Focus_on_EHT">https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205/page/Focus_on_EHT</a> (external link)</span>} link="https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205/page/Focus_on_EHT" external={true}/>

Across [several preprints](https://arxiv.org/search/astro-ph?query=Event+Horizon+Telescope+Collaboration&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50) (external link) and [eight peer-reviewed letters](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205/page/Focus_on_EHT) (external link), EHTC presented open results issued from different teams on instrumentation, observation, algorithm, software, modeling, and data management, providing the full scope of the project and the conclusions drawn to date.

Open results such as reports, publications, code, white papers, press releases, blog posts, videos, TED talks, and social media posts add to the comprehensive repertoire of open results supported by EHTC. Resources are centralized on the [EHTC website](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/) (external link), [GitHub organization](https://github.com/eventhorizontelescope) (external link), and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/%40ehtelescope) (external link) to provide easy access to all open results.

It's important to highlight that their efforts have led to independent re-analysis and regeneration of black hole images. Specifically, Patel et al not only reproduced the original finding, but also contributed additional documentation, code, and a computational environment as open-source containerized software package to ensure future testing. (Patel et al., 2022) Some of the original authors reviewed this work and [made their comments also available online](https://quarxiv.authorea.com/users/557984/articles/607408-review-reproducibility-of-the-first-image-of-a-black-hole-in-the-galaxy-m87-from-the-event-horizon-telescope-eht-collaboration) (external link).

### How Do I Connect Open Results to Make Reproducible Publications

If not considered from the start, it can become challenging to ensure result reproducibility at the publication stage. Assuming that you have maintained open results considering their reproducibility, you can start assembling them to connect with the final reporting and publication, with appropriate references to previous studies.

- Before writing your manuscript, assess each output to make sure that the appropriate license is attached for reuse, and that documentation has been provided and contributors are clearly listed. You can decide to create a version of the record and point to a permanent identifier such as via Zenodo so that the link never breaks when sharing them on a public repository (e.g. GitLab/GitHub) or manuscripts with a visible list of contributors.
- Your publications can be created individually (such as in the EHTC case study) or by combining several outputs or pieces of information in manuscripts. These will include resource requirements, dependencies, software, data, and the repository where code is shared with documentation and contributor information, among other research artifacts.
- The manuscript itself will describe research questions, methods, and individual figures and tables explaining the results. When writing a manuscript, you can begin with figures by packaging data, code and parameters used, and ensuring that information represented can be reproduced. You can find a detailed checklist in the publication by [Gil et al. (2016)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015EA000136) (external link).

As demonstrated in the EHTC case study, a final step towards making open results could be to create a meta article and/or simple website/GitHub page that centralizes all your research outputs. Different parts of research (individual open results) can be accessed centrally with details, including open recognition for all contributors.

If you are looking for concrete actions you can take to make open results, pick one of these four items:

- Improve how you define contributorship in your project and how authorship is assigned.
- Ensure the data or software in your paper is uploaded to Zenodo with the proper license and documentation. Include the metadata and the DOI in your scientific report and publication.
- Ensure that the process you use to collect data and perform its analysis, including all the dependencies and methods used in your data analysis pipeline, are clearly described to allow others to reproduce your results.
- Create a centralized repository or a simple GitHub page to centralize all research outputs with a contributors list.

## Lesson 3: Summary

The steps that we highlight to make open results are not intractable. In fact, the steps we have highlighted are things we can do on a regular basis to ensure that all research artifacts can be shared later as open and reproducible results. In this lesson we've learned:

- Approaches for making open results.
- The importance of collaboration in making results.
- How to recognize and credit all of the contributors who make results.
- How to combine different open results to create scientific reports and reproducible outputs.
