# Lesson 1: Introduction to Open Results

## Overview

This lesson aims to broaden your perspective regarding what shareable research outputs are produced throughout the research lifecycle. We will first consider what constitutes an open result. To do so, we will read an example of a forward-thinking research project that utilizes open result best practices. The perspectives gained from this example will ultimately get us thinking about how we can work towards creating reproducible research.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:

- Describe what constitutes open results and list the research products that can be created throughout a research cycle.
- Describe how sharing open results can advance science and your career.
- Explain what the reproducibility crisis is and how open science can help combat it.

## What Research Products are Created Throughout the Research Cycle?

### The Traditional Depiction of a "Scientific Result" Has Changed Over Time

When we think of results, most people think of just the final publication.

    <h3>21st century</h3>
    <p>Only by the 21st century did the scientific community expand the meaning of open results. The evolution of this definition was driven by technological advances, such as the internet, and advances in modes to share information. The open access movement was established by the <a href="https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/">Budapest Open Access Initiative</a> (external link) in 2002 and the <a href="https://openaccess.mpg.de/Berlin-Declaration">Berlin Declaration on Open Access</a> (external link) in 2003, both of which formalized the idea that, with regard to new knowledge, there should be "free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles". (Budapest Open Access Initiative, 2025)</p>

### But Results Have Always Been Far More Than Just the Publication

You might be familiar with the research life cycle, but may not have considered what results could be shared openly throughout its process. This lesson adopts a definition of the research life cycle based on work by Opensciency and The Turing Way and breaks it down into nine phases, pictured in the figure below. (OpenSciency Contributors, 2023; The Turing Way, 2024)

<SingleFigure size='full' src="./images/clone/Module_5/image7.jpeg" caption={<span>Image credit: NASA<br/>Open Science Workflow Products Source: Opensciency.</span>}/>

Although the phases are presented in a linear fashion, we acknowledge that the research lifecycle is rarely ever linear! Products are created throughout the scientific process that are needed to enable others to reproduce the findings. The products of research include journal articles, data, and code, as well as presentations, conference proceedings, reports, white papers, algorithms, models and simulations, outreach materials, tutorials, and many other products. The term 'Open Results' comprehensively includes all these research products and more.

Open results can include both data and code. Since data and code were covered in previous modules, in this lesson, we focus on sharing science outcomes as open results. Examples of open results can include:

- Open access peer-reviewed articles
- Technical reports
- Computational notebooks
- Code of conduct, contributor guidelines, publication policies
- Blog posts
- Short form videos and podcasts
- Social media posts
- Conference abstracts and presentations
- Forum discussions

Open access peer-reviewed articles are archived for long-term preservation and represent a more formal discussion of scientific ideas, interpretations, and conclusions. These discussions inform the method that researchers share results. In the following lesson section, we will discuss different types of sharing and methods to build and adapt them for use in your research.

Scientists can share their incremental progress throughout the research process and invite community feedback. Sharing more parts of the research process creates more interactions between researchers and can improve the end result (which may be a peer-reviewed article).

Throughout Module 5 we will show you how to use, make, and share open results.

### The Practice of 'Open'

Specifically, the "Use, Make, Share" format has been naturally embedded throughout the curriculum and should be a familiar format by now. Lesson 2 will cover "Using". Lesson 3 will cover "Making". Lesson 4 will cover "Sharing". Throughout this module, we will pay particular attention to manuscripts and other research products as examples because the previous modules covered "Use, Make, Share" in the context of components with data and software.

## Examples of Open Results

Let's broaden our perspectives on the types of **research products** that are produced throughout the research process. Here are some examples from different use cases.

### Case Study: Reaching New Audiences

<SingleFigure size='medium' src="./images/clone/Module_5/image9.jpeg" caption={<span>Google Earth Engine and geemap workshop at GeoPython Conference 2021 [Screenshot]. (2025). YouTube. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGjpjh9IQ5I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGjpjh9IQ5I</a> (external link)</span>}/>

Qiusheng Wu is an associate professor at University of Tennessee. He has published 500+ video tutorials on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/%40giswqs) (external link), which have gained 42K+ subscribers, and 1.9M+ views (as of 2/2025).

Professor Qiusheng Wu created a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/%40giswqs) (external link) in April 2020 for the purpose of sharing video tutorials on the [geemap Python package](https://geemap.org/) (external link) that he was developing. Since then, Wu has published over 700 video tutorials on open-source geospatial topics. The channel has gained over 42K subscribers, with more than 1.9 million views and more than 60K watch hours in total. On average, it receives 70 watch hours per day.

The YouTube channel has allowed Wu to reach a much larger audience beyond the confines of a traditional classroom. It has made cutting-edge geospatial research more accessible to the general public and has led to collaborations with individuals from around the world. This has been particularly beneficial for Wu's tenure promotion as it has resulted in increased funding opportunities, publications, and public engagement through the YouTube channel, social media, and GitHub.

Overall, the YouTube channel serves as an important tool for Wu to disseminate research, inspire others, and contribute to the advancement of science. It has also played a significant role in advancing Wu's professional career.

### Case Study: New Media for Science Products

In 2021, Lucas Sterzinger spent one summer of his PhD on an internship. During that summer, he wrote a blog post titled "A new method reduced the compute time for this image from ~30 minutes to \<1 minute" to explain and demonstrate a game-changing technology called Kerchunk - a software package that makes accessing scientific data in the cloud much faster. (Sterzinger, 2021) 

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_5/image10.jpeg" caption='Image credit: "Fake it until you make itâ€”Using Kerchunk to read NetCDF4 data on AWS S3 as Zarr for rapid data access" by Lucas Sterzinger, Medium, under CC-BY-NC 4.0'/>

Alongside the blog post, he also created a tutorial as a Jupyter Notebook - both of these resources and associated code are freely accessible to the public, allowing for rapid adoption and iteration by other developers and scientists. He posted the blog on Medium and posted about it on X (Twitter at the time). The blog got a lot of attention on a newly developed technology as it was being developed! This is starkly different from the slow and complicated world of academic publishing, where this result would not have been shared for about a year (writing it up, the review process, and the publication process). He said, "Working on Kerchunk and sharing it widely using open science principles greatly expanded my professional connections and introduced me to the field of research software engineering. The connections I made from this led me directly to my current role as a Scientific Software Developer at NASA." (L. Sterzinger, personal communication, 2023)

### Case Study: New Products for Increasing Impact

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_5/image11.png" caption='Image credit: "OpenStreetMap 2011" by Ken Vermette under CC BY-SA 3.0'/>

[OpenStreetMap](https://welcome.openstreetmap.org/) provides access to free, editable maps covering the entire world.  The maps include data about roads, buildings, addresses, businesses, points of interest, methods and avenues of transportation, natural features, and much more.  According to the website, the project, which was started in 2004 by Steve Coast, has more than 1 million contributors and 5 million users. OpenStreetMap is used by individuals, companies, nonprofits, and even governments.

The data can be used for navigation, as well as planning and logistics. (OpenStreetMap, n.d.) What began as a small project to address a lack of freely available map data, has grown into a resource used across the globe for purposes the creator could never have imagined. This was only possible because it was set up and shared openly and built by a community devoted to improving it. You never know where your personal project might go or who might be interested in collaborating!

### Case Study: New Visualizations to Share Results

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) was developed around 2002 by post-doc John Hunter to visualize some neurobiology data he was working on. He wasn't a software developer, he was a neurobiologist! He could have just published the paper in a peer-reviewed journal, and maybe shared his code to create the figures, but instead he started an open project on GitHub and thought: 'Well if this is useful to me, maybe it will be useful to others...'.

<SingleFigure size='medium' src="./images/clone/Module_5/image12.jpeg" caption={<span>Image credit: "Man in Black Suit Jacket Using Computer" by Kampus Production via <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a> (external link)</span>}/>

Matplotlib is now the most widely used plotting library for the Python programming language and a core component of the scientific Python stack, along with NumPy, SciPy, and IPython. Matplotlib was used for data visualization during the 2008 landing of the Phoenix spacecraft on Mars and for the creation of the first image of a black hole.

### Case Study: Reporting and Publication

And last but not least, we have an example by the JWST Early Release Science team from Module 1 on how they reported their results. This came in various forms, from publishing a peer-reviewed paper, preprints, blog posts, and social media. Their peer-reviewed publication was published open access in <i>Nature</i> along with a preprint through arXiv.

Open communication platforms furthered the reach and audience of results, enabled participation by more than 400 researchers, and ultimately contributed to an incredible discovery, the first detection of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere of a planet orbiting another star.

<SingleFigure size='full' src="./images/clone/Module_5/image13.jpeg" caption={

  </ul>
}/>

The public is interested in what you are doing, and reaching them can involve communication through traditional and new platforms. Publishing results on platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), YouTube, TikTok, blogs, websites, and other social media platforms is becoming more common. Awareness through social media drastically increases the reach and audience of your work. There have been studies on how this impacts citation rates. For example, <i>The Journal of Medical Internet Research</i> (JMIR) conducted a three-year study of the relative success of JMIR articles in both X (formerly Twitter) and academic worlds. They found that articles highly posted on X were 11 times more likely to be highly cited than less posted articles. (Eysenbach, 2011)

Open communication platforms noticeably furthered the reach and audience of results.

## What is the Reproducibility Crisis?

A 2016 <i>Nature</i> survey on reproducibility found that of 1,576 researchers, "More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments." (Baker, 2016) The 'reproducibility crisis' in science is a growing concern over several reproducibility studies where previous positive results were not reproduced.

We must consider the full research workflow if we are to solve the reproducibility crisis. The fact that 70% of researchers could not reproduce other scientists' results is shocking, especially considering that the reproducibility of science is the cornerstone of the scientific method.

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_5/image15.png" caption="Image credit: NASA"/>

There are many personal incentives to implement open science principles throughout all stages of the research process. By making results open throughout, you increase your ability to reproduce your own results. This also has implications for research beyond the ability to improve your research.

### What is the Cause of This Reproducibility Crisis?

<SingleFigure size='full' src="./images/clone/Module_5/image16.jpeg" caption="Image credit: NASA"/>

The three main causes of the reproducibility crisis are:

1. Intermediate methods of research are often described informally or not at all.
2. Intermediate data are often omitted entirely.
3. We often only think about results at the time of publication.

We need to think of the entire research process as a result. As an example, scientific articles describe computational methods informally which demands significant effort from others to understand and to reuse.

Articles often lack sufficient information needed for other researchers to reproduce results, even when data sets are published, according to two studies in <i>Nature Genetics</i> and <i>Nature Methods</i>. Raw and/or intermediate data products and relevant code are often not provided alongside the final manuscript, limiting the reader's ability to attempt replication. (Ioannidis et al., 2016; Bell et al., 2009)

Without access to the source codes for the papers, reproducibility has been shown to be elusive, according to two other studies in <i>Briefings in Bioinformatics</i> and <i>Nature Physics</i>. (Hothorn et al., 2011; Hay, 2015)

### Combating the Reproducibility Crisis

If your research workflow uses principles of open results, as showcased in the example, this will help you to combat the reproducibility crisis.

We can create reproducible workflows and combat this crisis by considering open results at each stage of the research lifecycle. An Open Science and Data Management Plan (OSDMP) helps researchers think and plan for all aspects of sharing by determining how they will make code and data available. This plan can be shared publicly early on through a practice called pre-registering, where researchers determine their analysis plan and data collection procedure before a study begins (discussed previously in Lesson 2 of Module 2).

### Activity 1.1: What Could You Do?

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_5/image21.png" caption="Image credit: NASA"/>

Let's rethink your research workflow. Identify the research products that could be (or could have been) shared as open results of a project you are/were involved in. What are high priority items for combating the reproducibility crisis in each area of the research workflow?

- Ideation
- Planning
- Project Design
- Engagement & Training
- Data Collection
- Data Wrangling
- Data Exploration
- Preservation
- Reporting & Publication

#### Key Takeaways: What Could You Do?

The OpenSciency team created a large table that describes all the different kinds of shareable research products that are possible to create throughout the research lifecycle.

#### The table is available here:

**Opensciency's Research stages and open result table**

<LearnButton text="CLICK TO LEARN (external link)" href="https://opensciency.github.io/sprint-content/open-results/lesson1-research-process-and-results.html#research-stages-and-open-result-table"/>

Thinking about sharing everything all at once can be overwhelming when you are getting started. To move forward, just focus on how you might pick the most important item. Here we have pared down the list to only a couple items per category. Furthermore, you could think about shortening the list even further when you are getting started. For example, maybe it is the case that, for your work, sharing the code used to wrangle the data is the most critical element to reproducibility. Therefore, code-sharing would be a good place to start your open science journey. The small steps we make are what move us towards sustainable open science.

- **Ideation:** Funded proposals can be shared on Zenodo and open grant platforms such as [ogrants.org](https://www.ogrants.org/grants-01-all) (external link).
- **Planning:** Projects can be pre-registered before they begin.
- **Project Design:** Contributor guidelines or a code of conduct can be posted on Zenodo, GitHub, or team Web Pages.
- **Engagement & Training:** Workflow computational notebooks can be shared with the team via GitHub and released on Zenodo.
- **Data Collection:** Raw data can be shared through data repositories.
- **Data Wrangling:** Code can be shared through software repositories.
- **Data Exploration:** Computational notebooks can be shared via GitHub and released on Zenodo.
- **Preservation:** Data management plans for archiving can be posted on Zenodo.
- **Reporting & Publication:**
  - Open access peer-reviewed articles 
  - Computational notebooks
  - Code of conduct, contributor guidelines, publication policies 
  - Blog posts
  - Short form videos and podcasts 
  - Social media posts
  - Conference abstracts, posters, and presentations (when made openly available) 
  - Forum discussions

## Lesson 1: Summary

In this lesson, you learned that:

- The contemporary scientific workflow involves being open about processes and products. Research products (results) include far more than just the final manuscript, which is a drastic change from the historical notion of a scientific result.
- At every stage of the research lifecycle, there are research products produced that we can consider results.
- We can combat the reproducibility crisis by sharing these research products at each stage of our research workflow.
- There are amazing examples of research groups sharing different types of open results!

Let's start thinking about what we can do immediately to work towards an open research workflow.
