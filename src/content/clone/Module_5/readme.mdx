## About This Module

Welcome to Open Results! This module focuses on giving you the tools you need to kick-start a scientific collaboration by creating contributor guidelines that ensure ethical contributorship. It begins with a use case of open science in action, then a review of how to discover and assess open results. Next, this module focuses on how to publish results, which includes a task checklist. The module wraps up with specific guidance for writing the section on sharing results in an Open Science and Data Management Plan (OSDMP). We will also reflect on how our society and technology are constantly evolving in the way we do science.

### Module Learning Objectives

After completing this module you should be able to:

- Describe what constitutes an open result.
- Explain what the reproducibility crisis is and how open science can help combat it.
- Use a process to discover, assess, and cite open results for reuse.
- List the responsibilities of the following participants that create open results: open results user, project leader, collaborator, contributor, and author.
- List the tasks for creating reproducible results and the items to include in a manuscript to ensure reproducible results.
- Define a strategy for sharing your results, such as selecting publishers, interpreting journal policies and licenses, and determining when to share your data or software with your manuscript.

<Definitions>
  <Definition title='Research Products'>
    <p>The outputs and results created during a research process.  This includes journal articles, data, and code, as well as presentations, conference proceedings, reports, white papers, algorithms, models and simulations, outreach materials, tutorials, and many other products.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Predatory Publishing'>
    <p>For-profit publishers that charge a publishing fee but provide few quality checks on the quality of the publication that would be expected from scholarly publications, such as peer review or type-setting.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Preprint'>
    <p>A version of a paper shared prior to the publication in a journal. This can be the author's version of the accepted manuscript after peer review or a version prior to submission to a journal.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Pre-registering'>
    <p>A practice by researchers to publicly document their research plan and data collection procedures before a study begins.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)'>
    <p>Long-lasting reference to a document, file, web page, or other digital object. It is usually used in the context of digital objects that are available over the internet. Most PIDs have a unique identifier which is linked to the current address of the metadata or content.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Reproducibility Crisis'>
    <p>The 'reproducibility crisis' in science is a growing concern over several reproducibility studies where previous positive results were not able to be reproduced.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='DOI'>
    <p>A digital object identifier is a persistent identifier's handle used to uniquely identify various objects. It is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Code of Conduct'>
    <p>A collection of rules and policies that outline the standards, principles, expectations, and morals for a group or organization. It is considered binding on any person who is a member of that group or organization.
