# Lesson 2: Using Open Data

## Overview

In this lesson you will learn how to discover, assess, and cite an open data set. Knowing these skills will greatly improve and expedite your research process. By exploring repositories, you will also learn about the issues and considerations for searching datasets. Then, you'll be able to determine if the dataset is suitable for your use by learning what to review in documentation, licenses, and file formats. Finally, the lesson will wrap up with a discussion about the importance of citing datasets, as well as how to read and follow citation instructions.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:

- Select reputable data sources and use key search techniques to discover open data.
- Assess if a dataset incorporates open access elements that ensure easy reusability.
- Explain the importance of citing open data, and find and follow citation instructions.

## Introduction

Open data isn't always simple to use in your research. Sometimes there are multiple versions of the same dataset, so learning how to discover, assess, and then use open data will help you save time.

As an example, look at the monthly average carbon dioxide data from Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. This foundational dataset constitutes the longest record of direct measurements of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere. These observations were started by C. David Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in March 1958 at a facility of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (_Scripps CO2 Program_, n.d.)

If you want to make this figure yourself, or use the data for some other purpose, first you will want to find the data. If you search for this dataset, or any data, chances are that you will find a number of different sources.

By starting with Google and searching for "Mauna Loa carbon dioxide data," you will find countless results. Here are just some of them:

    </ul>
  </span>
}/>

How do you decide which one to use? In this lesson, we will cover how to find open data, assess its relevance, and then use it in your own work.

## Discovering Open Data

Open data can be discovered by accessing data repositories, search portals, and publications. A wide variety of these resources are available online. A key step is identifying the appropriate search terms for your application. Learning community-specific nomenclature and standards can accelerate your search, saving you valuable time and resources.

### Where to Start Your Search

There are multiple pathways to find research data, and you should be practiced in all of them.

<SingleFigure size='large' src="./images/clone/Module_3/data_chart.png" caption="Credit: NASA"/>

### People You Know (Online or In-person)

What is the first and best way to find research data? Ask your community! This includes your research advisor, colleagues, team members, and people online. Knowing where to find reliable, good data is as much a skill as any lab technique. You learn this skillset by working with professionals in your field. There is no single best source and no one method. You may even find data from people that you might not expect.

### Publications

Datasets are often attached to scholarly publications in the form of supplementary material. Publication search engines can enable the discovery of relevant publications that you can then use to find data from a particular publication.

### Data Search Portals

Data can also be found by utilizing a wide variety of search portals such as:

<CustomTabs>
    <Tab eventKey="one" title="GENERIC DATA SEARCH PORTALS">
      <p>Generic data search portals enable discovery of a wide variety of data. Not built for specific disciplines, they serve a broader audience. This type of search portal collects and makes data findable. They are not sources of scientific data. These are aggregation services that emphasize quantity, not necessarily quality. This is where citizen scientists often go to find data, and it's a great way for non-professionals to get involved in science.</p>

### Repositories

A common way to share and find open data is through data repositories. Many repositories host open data with persistent identifiers, clear licenses and citation guidelines, and standard metadata.

Note that some of our example search portals are also repositories, but not always. Some of these search portals are simply catalogs of information about the data, rather than storage locations for the data themselves.

### Challenges with Data Repositories

- Any single repository, search engine, or publication search will not have access to all available open data.
- Search terms may not be consistent across sources or fields of science.
- It is essential to become familiar with the standard nomenclatures and appropriate metadata terms for your application.
- There is no sure-fire recipe. You may have to try numerous terms and data sources before finding relevant data.

## Assessing Open Data

<SingleFigure size='medium' src="./images/clone/Module_3/image24.png" caption="Credit: NASA"/>

Using open data for your project is contingent on a number of factors including quality of data, access and reuse conditions, data findability, and more. A few essential elements (adapted from an open data management course created by GODAN Action) that enable you to assess the relevance and usability of datasets include:

<Definitions>
    <Definition title='Practical Questions'>
      <ul>
        <li>Is the data well described?</li>
        <li>Is the reason the data is collected clear? Is the publisher&#39;s use for the data clear?</li>
        <li>Are any other existing uses of the data outlined? </li>
        <li>Is the data accessible?</li>
        <li>Is the data timestamped or up to date?</li>
        <li>Will the data be available for at least a year? </li>
        <li>Will the data be updated regularly?</li>
        <li>Is there a quality control process?</li>
      </ul>
    </Definition>
    <Definition title='Technical Questions'>
      <ul>
        <li>Is the data available in a format appropriate for the content? </li>
        <li>Is the data available from a consistent location?</li>
        <li>Is the data well-structured and machine-readable?</li>
        <li>Are complex terms and acronyms in the data defined? </li>
        <li>Does the data use a schema or data standard?</li>
        <li>Is there an API available for accessing the data? </li>
        <li>What tools or software are needed to use this data?</li>
      </ul>
    </Definition>
    <Definition title='Social Questions'>
      <ul>
        <li>Is there an existing community of users of the data?</li>
        <li>Is the data already relied upon by large numbers of people? </li>
        <li>Is the data officially supported?</li>
        <li>Are service level agreements available for the data?</li>
        <li>It is clear who maintains and can be contacted about the data?</li>
      </ul>
    </Definition>
</Definitions>

(GODAN Action, n.d.)

Many of these questions may be answered by viewing a dataset's documentation and metadata, as well as a data's format and license, all of which will be discussed further in Lesson 3, "Making Data Open."

## Using Open Data

### The Importance of Citation

Acknowledgements and citations contribute towards fostering a culture of sharing data without fear of ideas or recognition being stolen. If a researcher can trust that their work will be cited and used to further the development of science, the idea of making data open is more appealing and mutually beneficial. Use of standard citation practices is recommended to ensure due credit is given.

Data citations also aid in the transparency of how data is being used. By citing data, original authors and new researchers can easily track how the data is being used to answer different questions.

### Review Citing Guidelines

Many datasets and repositories explain how they'd prefer to be cited. The citation information often includes:

- Authors and their institutions
- Title
- ORCID
- DOI
- Version
- URL
- Creation date
- Additional fields may also be specified

<SingleFigure size='medium' src="./images/clone/Module_3/image25.jpeg" caption={<span><em>Simple CITATION.cff file</em> [Screenshot] GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>) (external link)</span>} link="https://github.com/" external={true}/>

At a minimum, most datasets require that you list the data's producers, the name of the archive hosting the data, dataset name, the dataset date, and the DOI when citing data.
