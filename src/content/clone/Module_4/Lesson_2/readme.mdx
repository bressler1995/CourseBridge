# Lesson 2: Using Open Code

## Overview

In the previous lesson, you learned the core principles of open code and how it can accelerate the scientific process. Here, you will discover how to use existing open code in your own work. This lesson will explore where to search for open code and assess it for desired qualities. Keep in mind the functionality, usability, and security of the open code you find. Then, you will learn how to reuse open software and employ its latest supported version, as well as how to test the software. Finally, you will dive into the best practices for citing and acknowledging open code.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:

- Describe the process for using open code and list some key elements of discovering code.
- Describe the four key considerations when assessing open software: functionality, interoperability, security, and licenses.
- List some common problems that arise when reusing open code and best practices to resolve them.
- Describe how, where, and under what circumstances one should acknowledge/cite code.

## Discovering Open Code and Software

Many people discover code through discussions with their colleagues, reading journal articles, or attending talks at conferences. These are great ways to find code that might have applications for your scientific problem or research question.

What are other ways someone can search for open code? As a first step, look for code that already exists, because chances are that someone else has already had a similar problem and published their code online. A common way to search for existing code is with a general search engine. Search engines offer one indicator of a code's relevancy, how recently it was updated, and how frequently others reference it.

<Definitions>
  <Definition title='Example'>
    <p>I'm a new graduate student starting to work on modeling turbulence in the Southern Ocean to better understand sea surface temperature (or ocean heat uptake) and ocean dynamics. Is there some software available to model how eddies in the ocean affect sea-surface temperature?</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Exercise'>
    <p>General Search for the term "software for ocean turbulence modeling"</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Result'>
    <p>General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM)</p>
  </Definition>
</Definitions>

This successful search is predicated on the developers of GOTM making their code open.

### Open Software Discovery Depends on Developers Following FAIR Principles

The discoverability of open software depends on developers making their software easy to find. The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) Principles for research software suggest:

- Software and its associated metadata must be easy for humans and machines to find.
- Software must be described with rich, searchable, and indexable metadata.
- Software must be findable from all relevant search points. 

(Wilkinson et al., 2016)

However, you may have more specific needs. The following sections cover additional ways to help discover relevant software that meets specific research demands.

### How to Search for Open Code

A successful search for open code demands a clearly-defined purpose. Developers must first determine the tasks they expect their code to carry out. The requirements associated with these tasks can determine the best-suited programming language.

Next, if you want to find open code with similar requirements to your own, familiarize yourself with the terminology employed by others. The keywords affiliated with your programming purpose or requirements can serve as a starting point when searching for relevant code. These keywords can be found in community forums about open source programming and in related scientific journal articles. With adoption of open access principles by many academic journals, prospective programmers can peruse scientific papers from fields related to their research in order to find, and sometimes make use of, existing code that will fulfill their requirements.

### Know Where to Search

The open code ecosystem is vast, organic, multifaceted, and highly distributed.

If you are looking for scientific code, community standards have increasingly required code to be published and linked to scientific papers.

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_4/image333.jpg" caption="Image Credit: NASA"/>

Thus, the scientific literature and its ancillary code archives are a great place to look for scientific open code.

Most open code is not developed by or for scientists. However, open code enables research every day.

### Where to Look Depends on What You Need

There are several popular search engines for code snippets. First, you can simply search on Google. Other commonly-used search engines include GitHub Code Search and Stack Overflow. These search engines allow you to search for specific code snippets by programming language, keyword, or other criteria. GitHub Code Search allows you to search GitHub, a popular code repository for scientific code. Stack Overflow allows you to search forums, where users discuss solutions to coding problems.

#### Examples of code repositories:

With open code, knowing where to search and what to search for can be a challenging problem. You can always start with a Google search. However, it can be valuable to think through some of the questions that guide the discovery process. If the user lacks relevant experience, it can also be helpful to engage experienced colleagues at this stage.

Review the flow chart below that illustrates how a search follows the definition of the need:

### Open Software is Aggregated and Searchable in Repositories

A software repository is an online collection of stand-alone application software packages. Repositories typically control access and track the deployments/downloads of packages.

Software packages are often provided as executables without code.

The collection typically includes metadata, documentation, and licensing restrictions on each package. It may include different software package versions and the platforms or environments on which the software package can be executed.

Most research code should be open source software, which is stored in code repositories.

#### Examples of software repositories are:

## Assessing Open Code and Software

So, you've discovered some exciting open code that might help you solve your scientific problem. But there are several key questions to consider: Can you trust this code you discovered on the web? How much time will it take to learn it? Could the code contain malware? Could you get in legal trouble for using it?

**Example:** You found the "General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM)" on the internet, and it looks promising. Or, you just found lots of code snippets and functions related to the Lomb-Scargle power spectrum. Now, you would like to assess these pieces of code to help you decide if you should use them. 

This section discusses some best practices for assessing whether the code will help you.

### Four General Considerations for Assessing Open Software

Software assessment criteria are similar, for any level of openness:

- **Functionality:** Will it be useful for your scientific problem?
- **Interoperability:** How difficult will it be to use?
- **Security:** Is it safe? Would using the software create a security risk?
- **Licenses/restrictions:** Are you allowed use it? Is it legal to use the software in your project?

### Functionality: Assessing Scientific Utility

<SimpleSlider>
    <SliderItem>
        <h4>Does the software meet your scientific needs?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Does it address your specific science question? </li>
            <li>Do studies similar to yours use it?</li>
            <li>Which papers cite it, and how do they use it?</li>
            <li>Do your advisors or colleagues have experience with it?</li>
        </ul>
    </SliderItem>
    <SliderItem>
        <h4>Testing the scientific compatibility</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Does the software contain scientific test cases? If so, reproduce a case that is applicable to your problem; make sure the results are as expected.</li>
            <li>If you've done similar scientific analysis/modeling previously, reproduce your prior results with the new software. Are the results consistent?</li>
            <li>Incrementally modify a given test case to address new scientific questions. Alternatively, develop your own case, if necessary, following relevant examples.</li>
        </ul>
    </SliderItem>
</SimpleSlider>

### Interoperability: Ease of Use

<SimpleSlider>
    <SliderItem>
        <h4>Is the code written in a language that you are familiar with?</h4>
        <p>It can be easier to first use coding languages that you are familiar with, then import your code into existing software rather than try to use a new language. On the other hand, the use of existing packages and executables can accelerate your work.</p>
    </SliderItem>
    <SliderItem>
        <h4>Check for good documentation</h4>
        <p>Check any README files. Does the code meet your functional requirements? Are the environmental dependencies well-defined and reasonable?</p>
    </SliderItem>
    <SliderItem>
        <h4>Check the evidence of interoperability with other projects and codes</h4>
        <p>It is a good sign if you can find evidence that the code has been used successfully by other users that had similar scientific or technical needs.</p>
    </SliderItem>
</SimpleSlider>

### Factors for Assessing the Quality of Open Source Software

To quickly assess the community usage and quality of software in a repository, use the tools from the repository where you found it. GitHub, for example, permits a quick scan of development activity as evidenced by the number of times the code has been downloaded or, in GitHub parlance, 'forked.' You can also view the amount of activity in a community. GitHub also provides insights into the quality of the software.

<SingleFigure size='medium' src="./images/clone/Module_4/image291.jpg" caption={<span>Modified <em>GitHub search</em> [Screenshot]. (2023). GitHub. <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy">https://github.com/astropy/astropy</a> (external link)</span>} link="https://github.com/astropy/astropy" external={true}/>

### The Importance of the README File

- Is a universally-accepted starting point when assessing software.
- Explains what the software does, how to install and use it, or points to files with that information.
- Assumes limited prior knowledge by the reader or potential user.
- Includes a compatibility description, e.g. dependencies.
- Includes usage examples and/or test cases.

### Security: Considerations When Using Open Code

You've found some open code that will help you solve your scientific problem, and it looks easy to use! However, you may still have some reservations. Perhaps you are unsure if the code poses a security risk, for example.

The risks are relatively low for small snippets of code that are easy for you to fully understand. However, you may not be able to fully understand all components of a large open software package.

Open software is perceived to have more security risks. This is generally less of a problem for open-source code than executables, because the code can be audited for security vulnerabilities by the community. How can you assess security for the code you have discovered?

- Consult with your institutional open software policies and IT staff.
- Use security tools to check for vulnerabilities, e.g. [Open Worldwide Application Security Project®](https://owasp.org/) (external link).  
- Check with your latest institutional policies on using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence tools.

Best practices for using open code:
- Use authoritative, reputable sources to minimize security risks.
- Set strict security rules and standards when using a dependency.
- Avoid unsupported open source software. Switch to actively developed components or develop it yourself.
- Use caution when using external tools with secure or closed access data. It may be possible for the external tool to publicly share what should be restricted information.

### Licenses

So, you want to reuse some open code you discovered. It is essential to check the legal restrictions and requirements imposed on users, which are generally provided in the license.

Although licensing is a nuanced subject that you will learn more about in Lesson 3, it is useful to be aware that there are generally two classes of license: permissive and non-permissive. Permissive licenses, most commonly Apache 2.0, MIT, or BSD, will generally allow you to use the code for your scientific research with little restriction, whereas non-permissive licenses such as copy-left licenses impose substantial restrictions on how you use the code and require more careful consideration.

## Reusing Open Code

Software and code can be reused in a variety of ways. A software package can be executed on its own to provide a complete analysis or model depending on the input parameters. Alternatively, the package could be imported as part of a larger library to provide specific functionality. Also, code snippets can be copied into existing code, if permitted, or the code could be re-written and incorporated into new software.

If you simply intend to reuse a code snippet, continuously test that your selected code works as you expect. If you are reusing a more complex code, there are additional considerations.

### Selecting the Appropriate Version for Reuse

Consider the following when selecting among multiple versions of open source software.

<MultiSlider infinite={false}>
    <SliderItem type="multi">
        <h3>Use the latest stable release when possible</h3>
        <p>Just like software updates to your phone, computer's operating system, or apps, it is important to use the latest stable release. Developers often release developmental versions that include new features or bug fixes that are not fully tested. For this reason, using a developmental release is generally not recommended.</p>
    </SliderItem>
    <SliderItem type="multi">
        <h3>Determine the origin of the version you intend to use</h3>
        <p>Determine whether the version you intend to use comes from a modified open-source project or from its original source project. With this information, determine which source is more appropriate for your project.</p>
    </SliderItem>
    <SliderItem type="multi">
        <h3>Check for issues and bugs</h3>
        <p>Check for any known issues or bugs with your selected version that could cause problems. Find current information on issues or bugs by checking release notes, issue trackers, and developer forums.</p>
    </SliderItem>
</MultiSlider>

### Resolve Problems Experienced While Reusing Software

- Implement tests to verify that the software performs as expected in your application.
- If you run into problems, revisit the release notes, issue tracker, and/or user and developer forums.
- Don't be afraid to ask experienced colleagues for help.
- It is better to seek and obtain help in a public forum than using private communication (e.g. email). Part of open science is working in the open. Often you may find through your search that other users have had similar questions. Someone may have already offered a solution. If not, it is likely that others will benefit from your question being answered in public.

### Activity 2.1: Ways to Get Help Using Open Software
In this activity, you will select from a list of ways to resolve some common problems that arise when using open software.

#### Exercise 4

After answering the questions above, work through some specific examples of how you would resolve problems on your own. For example, navigate to the astropy code repository on GitHub (or another repository of your choice) and find the README and LICENSE files. Determine how you would contact the developers for help, etc.

## Citing and Acknowledging Open Code Use

Imagine that you've used open code pulled from the web and it made a big difference in your project research paper. How should you provide due credit for the open access code that contributed to your research?

**Example:** You managed to implement GOTM to learn something new about ocean turbulence in the Southern Ocean, or you managed to compute a Lomb-Scargle periodogram using astropy. 

Here are some questions to consider:

<SimpleSlider>
    <SliderItem>
        <h3>Should you cite the Open Code?</h3>
        <p>Cite any code that you view as having contributed to your research: </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Did the code play a critical part in your research?</li>
        <li>Did the code provide something novel?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In most cases, a code snippet on Stack Overflow does not constitute a citable research contribution. However, an author can still decide to cite it if they choose.</p>
        <p>Instances when shared code directly impacts the scientific results and requires a detailed description include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Numerical modeling or simulation</li>
        <li>Automated analysis, such as image processing or optical recognition</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Refer to the journal where you will be publishing to determine if they have specific instructions on how to cite software, e.g. <a href="https://journals.aas.org/news/software-citation-suggestions/">AAS Software Citation Suggestions</a> (external link).</p>
        <p>In some cases, a software's licensing terms and conditions require acknowledgment or citation in the references or bibliography of any publications based on the research that made use of the software.</p>
    </SliderItem>
    <SliderItem>
        <h3>How to cite?</h3>
        <p>Ideally, use and cite code that is archived in a long-term repository with a persistent DOI. Follow the guidance about the preferred citation format, which is usually provided in the long-term repository and may appear in a README or a CITATION file.</p>
        <p>DOIs provide a persistent identifier/link for research outputs. Thus, it is preferable to cite code in long-term repositories linked to a DOI. URLs (e.g. Stack Overflow) and active repositories (e.g. on GitHub) are mutable but can be used if there is no alternative.</p>
        <p>Packages may provide a way to cite individual versions as well. For reproducibility, cite both the overall package and the version that is used in your work. As functionality of a package may evolve with the release of new versions, this helps provide a specific description of your work.</p>
        <p>If you are writing software, you can also cite the software that you have used during your work in the comments and documentation.</p>

## Lesson 2: Summary

In this lesson, you learned that:

- Open code exists in a vast, organic, and distributed ecosystem. Discovering open code depends on defining your requirements, knowing where to look, and using FAIR principles.
- Scientific papers are now a good place to discover scientific open code, since many journals require the code used in the paper to be linked via a DOI.
- Before use, it is important to assess open software for functionality, quality, interoperability, security, and license/reuse restrictions. Your first step should be to look for a README file for these details.
- When reusing open software, use the latest supported version and test the software to ensure it functions as expected. If problems arise, reach out to the developers or user community, ideally via a public forum.
- It is important to cite and acknowledge open code and software that significantly contributes to your work, and share your lessons learned or any contributions openly with the developers and user community.
