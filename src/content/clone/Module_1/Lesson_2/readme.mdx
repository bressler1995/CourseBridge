# Lesson 2: Why is Open Science Important?

## Overview

In this lesson, you will learn how adopting open science benefits you as a researcher and society more broadly. Open science practices such as using, making, and sharing also ensures that everyone involved in the process receives their due credit. You will also learn about some of the challenges with using open science principles. By learning these hurdles and how to navigate them, you will be better-prepared for implementing the practice of open science.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:

- Describe the ways in which open science benefits your career through attribution, reach, and more collaborations.
- Describe the ways in which open science can advance science.
- List the benefits society receives when open science principles are adopted.


## Open Science Breaks Down Stovepipes and Increases Innovation

As NASA looks outward, we face both known and unforeseen challenges. These dynamic challenges will demand a new approach to science that achieves success through a responsive scientific ecosystem. This ultimately requires more teams - teams with more hands, eyes, and brains with various experience levels - to participate.

In the previous lesson, we learned about foundational concepts that define open science - its importance, its purpose, and its proven successes. In this lesson, we will address the key benefits and challenges of implementing open science principles in research activities.

By presenting this perspective on the development of science, we can focus on the intersection of scientific results, the process of creation, and the stakeholders that constitute the community.

Open science also benefits a wide range of stakeholder groups, and you will take a look at examples that invite further investigation. Additionally, this lesson explores common challenges to adopting open science practices.

## Benefits to You

### You are Your Best Future Collaborator!

Doing open science not only lets other people understand and reproduce your results, but lets you do so as well! Implementing open science principles such as good documentation and version control helps your future self, potential collaborators, and anyone else to understand your results.

If your work is shared publicly, you will never lose access even if you move institutions or change jobs. By sharing your data, code, and results in open repositories, you will always have access to them.

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_1/image261.png" caption="Image credit: NASA"/>

Implementing best practices for open science in your work not only helps you access your research, it could also strengthen your funding proposals. Funding agencies have begun to realize that openly sharing research products can increase the reuse of work and encourage higher citations, resulting in a better return on investment.

Well-documented research products also demonstrate the quality of your work, which helps with public communication efforts and can also attract better collaborators. Reliability and a strong work ethic motivate others to want to work with you.


### Give and Get Credit When Using Results of Others

<SingleFigure size='large' src="./images/clone/Module_1/image260.jpg" caption={<span>Image credit: The Turing Way project illustration by Scriberia is licensed under CC-BY 4.0. <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/13882307">DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3332807</a> (external link)</span>} link="https://zenodo.org/records/13882307" external={true}/>

In addition to documenting your own research, the practice of giving credit to everyone who has contributed will strengthen your scientific community reputation and actualize the shared values of open science. As people gain confidence in the benefits of collaborative research, they will also start giving credit to more contributions that might previously have gone unacknowledged. Often required by journals, attribution for work performed as part of a paper can be given in an author contribution statement, like the example below. Additionally, it is important to also include an acknowledgement statement to give credit to those who have shared resources, equipment, or knowledge, without which the final product or paper may not have been possible.

### More Visibility and Impact

In addition to improved scientific accuracy, adhering to open science practices potentially offers personal career benefits to researchers. Openly-published research has significantly more visibility and impact potential with large audiences across the internet, which can lead to more citations, like-minded collaborators, and career/funding opportunities, according to a 2016 study. (McKiernan et al., 2016)

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_1/image263.png" caption="Image credit: NASA"/>

#### Emerging evidence indicates that some aspects of open science can increase your citations.

Publishing open access increases citation count by 18%, according to a 2018 study. (Piwowar et al., 2018)

Articles that make their data openly accessible via a direct link to a repository see ~25% higher citation impact, according to another 2020 study. (Colavizza et al., 2020)

However, publishing as open access may have prohibitive costs for some researchers, depending on the venue. There are often other options that allow authors to share their work freely and openly. In Module 5, "Open Results," we discuss some of these additional options, including preprints and Diamond Open Access.

There are many different research outputs that can be openly shared and made citable:

- Code
- Data
- Research talk slides
- Lectures
- Blog posts
- And more!

All of these are tangible, scientific outputs. Much of our time as researchers is spent writing code, collecting data, and putting together lectures, not just creating publications. Sharing materials publicly makes receiving a citation more likely.

<SingleFigure size='medium' src="./images/clone/Module_1/image269.png" caption="Image credit: NASA"/>

### More Collaborations

Open science practices can also enable stronger collaborations, both within and between disciplines, as evidenced by a 2016 study. (Hormia-Poutanen and Forsström, 2016) The ease of access to open data allows for broader and more varied participation from a variety of new groups. Open science practices, such as pre-registration - where researchers document their research plan at the start of a study - allows for a stronger research design because feedback from various collaborators and stakeholders can be solicited before data collection begins. Similarly, preprints allow for swifter feedback on conclusions drawn from data once it is collected.

### Activity 2.1: Benefits to You

In this activity, reflect on your answers to the questions and then compare your thoughts to the key takeaways.

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_1/lightbulb.png" caption="Image credit: NASA"/>

- Can you find your own previous work, post-publication and/or pre-publication? Can you bring your research materials (data, code, results) with you if you change institutions?
- Can you find the work of your collaborators? Of researchers in other fields that you find interesting? Have you reached out to others to collaborate with them after finding interesting results?
- Are people in your field giving and getting credit for work done?

**Key Takeaways: Beneﬁts to You**

- Being more open encourages best research practices and makes it easier for you to build on your work.
- Open results have more visibility and impact.
- Open science encourages more collaborative science.

## Benefits to Science

### Transparent Science is Reproducible Science

When computers are used to produce scientific research, the code is considered a "method." Much like a lab research setting, a set of instructions can also be considered a method. Peer-reviewed methods are an essential step in the scientific process. When these steps are not shared, others cannot reproduce the work or build upon it for future scientific endeavors. Open methods allow people to judge whether or not the methods are trustworthy.

### Open Science Can Improve Accuracy

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_1/image267.png" caption="Image credit: NASA"/>

A recent study (Chambers and Tzavella, 2022) found that researchers who practice transparency and promote verifiability benefit from readers and stakeholders who judge whether the results presented are accurate and, according to a related study (John et al., 2012), that the results are not produced by questionable research practices, leading to misleading or unreliable results.

Open science also allows others to scrutinize the analytic decisions of researchers, such as whether the analysis was planned before or after observing the data, according to a 2018 study. (Nosek et al., 2018)

This allows others to check if they can arrive at the same conclusion as the original research team, and facilitates stronger public trust and support, according to a 2021 UNESCO report. (UNESCO, 2021)

Here is an open science example that was able to identify a key coding error that led to the publishing of inaccurate results. The study, originally published in _Acta Psychologica_, investigated whether the challenges in understanding speech signals would also lead to sequential processing adjustments with changes in frequency of auditory signals. After publishing the paper, the authors shared their Matlab files, which included the script used to analyze the data from their human subject study. A colleague reviewing the files discovered a coding error in the script and quickly reported it to the authors. Upon further analysis with the corrected code, the results were much less significant than originally thought and thus did not provide the evidence necessary for the original published conclusions. The author then contacted the journal editor and requested a [retraction](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2019.102886) (external link), providing the details of the error and re-analysis.

<SingleFigure size='medium' src="./images/clone/Module_1/retraction_example_large.jpg" caption={<span>Image credit: Image reprinted with permission from <em>Acta Psychologica</em>. Copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V.</span>}/>

The figure above, marked up by the authors in their [retraction statement](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2019.102886) (external link), indicates that the FluencyN-1 was incorrect in the original publication, which mistakenly reported a significant interaction that led to inaccurate conclusions. 

The results of studies on speech and hearing can have important impacts for those with hearing impairment and other auditory challenges. Thus, just as with any other scientific investigation, it is essential that published results are accurate. The willingness of the authors to share their study materials - including the code used to analyze the data and generate conclusions - combined with their transparency with the journal editors resulted in the quick identification of an error and subsequent action of the authors to retract the paper before it could be cited. The retraction was highlighted by Retraction Watch as an example of responsible publishing practices in the article ["Doing the Right Thing: Psychology Researchers Retract Paper Three Days After Learning of Coding Error"](https://retractionwatch.com/2019/08/13/doing-the-right-thing-psychology-researchers-retract-paper-three-days-after-learning-of-coding-error/) (external link).

### Open Science Leads to More Discoveries

The [Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)](https://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/) has been sending home images of our dynamic sun, opening up a new era of solar observation. It was designed to answer heliophysics science questions. However, planetary scientists found SOHO useful for its ability to spot comets that pass extremely close to the sun, known as sungrazers. SOHO's large field of view, primarily used to view giant surface explosions regularly produced by the sun called coronal mass ejections, is also large enough to see a sungrazing comet as it slingshots around the sun.

SOHO's great success as a comet finder is, of course, dependent on the people who sift through SOHO's data - a task made open to the world through real-time publicly available data.

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_1/image268.jpg" caption="Image credit: SOHO/ESA/NASA/NRL"/>

A cadre of volunteer amateur astronomers have dedicated themselves to searching this data via the NASA-funded [Sungrazer Project](https://science.nasa.gov/citizen-science/the-sungrazer-project/). While scientists often search the imagery for very specific solar events, various members of the astronomy community choose to comb through all available imagery in fine detail for other interesting occurrences, like comets. To date, over 2,300 comets have been discovered and 75% of them were found by citizen scientists. The images containing human-identified comets can also be used to create training datasets to improve the algorithms and software used by scientists to autonomously identify comets. 

In 2022, NASA decided to fund a [challenge](https://www.topcoder.com/community/nasa/soho-comet-search) (external link) open to the public to create new algorithms to identify comets in SOHO images. As a result, new, innovative algorithms were developed and two new comets were discovered!

### Quality of Scholarly Communications

Furthermore, open science improves the state of scientific literature. Scientific journals have traditionally faced the issue of publication bias, where journal articles overwhelmingly feature novel and positive results, according to a 2018 study. (DeVito and Goldacre, 2018) This results in a state where scientific results in certain disciplines published may have a number of exaggerated effects, or even be "false positives" (wrongly claiming that an effect exists), making it difficult to evaluate the trustworthiness of published results, according to both a 2011 study (Simmons et al., 2011) and a separate 2016 study (Nissen et al., 2016). Open science practices, such as registered reports, mitigate publication bias and improve the trustworthiness of the scientific literature. Registered reports are journal publication formats that peer-review and accept articles before data collection is undertaken, eliminating the pressure to distort results, according to a 2022 study. (Chambers and Tzavella, 2022) Other open science practices, such as pre-registration, also allow a partial look into projects that for various reasons (such as lack of funding, logistical issues, or shifts in organizational priorities) that have not been completed or disseminated, according to a 2023 study, giving these projects a publicly-available output that can help inform about the current state research. (Evans et al., 2023)

<SingleFigure size='medium' src="./images/clone/Module_1/image254.png" caption="Image credit: NASA"/>

By using openly available tools and making our scientific process and products more openly available, we can ensure that all who wish to involve themselves can take part in the global scientific community.

### Key Takeaways: Beneﬁts to Science

- Open science can accelerate scientific discovery. Collective knowledge is not only faster, but more effective than individual efforts.
- Open science allows for errors to be quickly corrected, making science more accurate.
- Open science practices, such as registered reports, mitigate publication bias and improve the trustworthiness of scientific literature.


## Benefits to Society

The mainstream adoption of open science began relatively recently. The potential benefits of open science extend beyond research through contributions to society and policy.

Collaboration, innovation, education, technology advancement, and science-based public policy are all improved by the open availability of research products. Sharing all research products (e.g. data, code, results) makes the scientific process more transparent, which in turn may help increase public trust in science. Also, open science increases involvement of citizen-scientists and non-experts in the research process. The varied perspectives from an open community invites unique perspectives that contribute to a more robust and often more accurate scientific outcome.

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_1/image264.png" caption="Image credit: NASA"/>

Scientists study issues that affect every aspect of life. Yet, public interest in science remains low due to a lack of trust, understanding, and sociocultural factors. How can scientists expect the public to trust science on complex and often contentious issues - whether it is vaccine development or landing on the Moon - if they don't allow the public to see the process and results? Building trust in science is essential to a well-informed society, and open science provides a pathway to do this.

The public who funds government research through taxes should be entitled to results and data, as long as safety and security are not an issue. Science should be more open to ensure its insights benefit the public who enables it.

Open science introduces more scrutiny into research, helping to ensure accuracy and encourage efficiency through open discourse. This approach accelerates the pace of discovery and subsequently the dissemination of results to the public and policymakers.

### Open Science Can Accelerate the Pace of Science

The Zika virus, which is one of many viruses transmitted by mosquitoes, became the subject of serious concerns during an outbreak after researchers began to notice that a rise in infections in pregnant women coincided with increases in microcephaly in fetuses and newborns. This link was confirmed by the CDC in 2016. 

<SingleFigure size='medium' src="./images/clone/Module_1/zika_example.JPG" caption={<span>Image credit: The Open Zika project used IBM's World Community Grid and machine learning to identify drug candidates for treating Zika virus.  Image reprinted with permission from the <em>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling</em>. Copyright 2024 American Chemical Society.</span>}/>

With an urgent need for treatments to combat Zika, a global, collaborative crowd-sourced, open science project, [OpenZika](https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/research/zika/overview.s) (external link), was initiated. OpenZika integrated computational and experimental strategies, which allowed for the quick screening of millions of compounds against all Zika virus protein structures discovered by researchers around the world. The results of all screening studies were made publicly available such that multiple treatment candidates could be identified. This example of open science led to significant advancements in the way we treat symptoms and reduce the risk of complications for those infected with Zika, improving our medical capabilities and saving countless lives.

### Open Science is Efficient Science

Open science reciprocates the benefits it provides to researchers with the communities that scientists hope to serve. Data from one observation or science experiment can have unanticipated uses. In Lesson 1, we discussed an example where the use of radar data was used to observe changing bird migration patterns in response to large-scale weather and climate patterns originating thousands of miles from the birds.

Through open science practices, research waste can be avoided, such as unintentional and costly repetition of previous studies, according to a 2020 European Commission report. (Baker et al., 2020) In the human sciences, this also reduces participant fatigue in the long term. By maximizing what is learned from publicly-available data, one does not need to test research repeatedly. By “giving away” science, individuals, communities and institutions can more easily adopt research results to inform interventions for their own needs without the knowledge being gatekept by the original researchers and institutions involved. In this way, open science can strengthen the social and economic impacts of scientific results.

### Open Science Attracts a Varied Set of Participants

The open sharing of scientific products and processes makes science available to everyone. This allows full participation from everyone and also maximizes the number of people who can benefit from the work.

The best way to include a group of open science researchers is to remove existing barriers. Beyond this, it is important to learn how to communicate effectively with collaborators, people at different skill levels, career levels, backgrounds, and areas of expertise. The ability to build and manage teams is a skill that everyone can learn.

### Key Takeaways: Benefits to Society

- The public, who funds government research through taxes, should be entitled to its results and data, as long as safety and security are not an issue.
- Open science allows for errors to be quickly corrected and accurate results to be built upon by others, impacting policies.
- Open science decreases the unintentional and costly repetition of previous studies, accelerating science that benefits society.

## Lesson 2: Summary
