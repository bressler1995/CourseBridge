# Lesson 5: Planning for Open Science: From Theory to Practice

## Overview

This module is nearly over, but there's so much more information available about open science - so our last lesson is for everyone who wants to learn more. In this lesson, you will review ways to start your journey with open science, including a list of resources that you can use now.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:

- List considerations to include in planning for open science and define an open science and data management plan (OSDMP).
- Describe the different parts of the scientific workflow and how open science can be integrated into it.
- Differentiate real world examples of how a team can use open science.
- List four steps that anyone can take to be more open.

## Planning for Open Science

<SingleFigure size='medium' src="./images/clone/Module_1/prof-paul-clouds.png" caption='Image credit: NASA'/>

It is important to think about, discuss, and plan for desired outcomes and processes when you begin your research. Learn about where the best repositories are for your materials, discuss credit and authorship for each separate open science output, and start using open science tools to organize your work. Reach out to repositories in your discipline and institution (usually the library) for help. Including this information in your plans will make you more likely to receive funding.

Planning for outputs in advance includes:

- Speaking about it and organizing with your research team
- Deciding which tools to use
- Thinking about authorship and credit
- Engaging with relevant stakeholders and research partners (e.g. industry, around open science)
- Identifying repositories for code and data
- Identifying journals (or other outlets) for publications
- Highlighting these approaches in your grant and much more

In reality, there is an exploratory stage where sharing one's product may not be part of the plan. During active research and data exploration, data, code, and ideas may be created and deleted even daily. It may not be efficient to spend time making these fully open (e.g. creating DOIs, documentation) because you are just exploring. Still, one may choose to make their code public through this process (it should be in some version control repository anyway, no harm in making it public). Part of this planning is beginning to think about what would be valuable to science and figuring out how you might share it.

It is important to discuss open science with your research team, lab, group, or partners regularly. Much of responsible open science may seem to be related to outputs - such as data, code, and publications - but preparing and organizing work for these in advance is critical. It is much more difficult to follow leading practices for these at the end of research, in the "afterthought" mode. Open science is both a mindset and culture that starts when you begin a project.

### Open Science and Data Management Plans

Federal agencies and funders consider data management crucial for open science because it ensures that research data is well-organized, accessible, and preserved. In recent years, many have included an Open Science and Data Management Plan (OSDMP) as a requirement for part of a proposal or project plan. While the Open Science and Data Management Plan may sound quite similar to a data management plan (DMP), as you may have guessed, it includes components beyond the scope of the traditional DMP. In addition to data, these plans can include the project's code and software, publications, and project governance, often including a much greater focus on how these products will be shared with other researchers and the public. The OSDMP includes a description of the resources to be used, the products that will be created, how they will be shared, and who will be responsible. OSDMPs are often submitted as a section within a proposal package that describes how a proposer plans to manage and deliver all their research products in the most publicly available way.

Open Science and Data Management Plans are essential because they enhance the credibility and reproducibility of research by ensuring that data, code, and research products are well-documented, organized, and preserved over time. Effective OSDMPs can have the following benefits:

<Definitions>
  <Definition title='Transparency'>
    <p>Builds trust in scientific findings but also allows other researchers to validate and build upon them, fostering a culture of openness and cooperation.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Effective'>
    <p>Data management can lead to more efficient and cost-effective research processes. By reducing the time spent searching for and organizing data, researchers can dedicate more time to analysis and interpretation, potentially accelerating the pace of discovery and innovation.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Reproducibility'>
    <p>A key tenet of the scientific method is reproducibility. A well-developed OSDMP helps ensure that others are able to validate your results.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Preservation'>
    <p>The research produced by federal funding represents a significant investment and it is important that research is saved for future generations to access and understand.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Quality'>
    <p>OSDMPs can include research tools and processes that can significantly improve research outcomes through collaboration and consultation.</p>
  </Definition>
</Definitions>

OSDMPs will be explored further in upcoming modules.

### An Open Strategy

A full OSDMP will not be required for all solicitations. Even when an OSDMP is not required, funding agencies and foundations often expect proposals to include an open science strategy. By including an open science strategy in your scientific plan, you ensure accessibility and openness in each step of your workflow. Conclude your comprehensive plan with clearly-defined steps to make research outputs easily accessible and openly available. The steps identified in your strategy should be integrated into your everyday scientific processes and practices.

<Definitions>
  <Definition title='Address Requirements'>
    <p>Every major research foundation and federal government agency now requires scientists to file a data management plan (DMP) along with their proposed scientific research plan. Some ask for additional details on software/code and publications. Be sure to address all of the funding agencies requirements in your open science strategy.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Include Entire Data Workﬂow Details in the Plan'>
    <p>Describe your management workflow for data and related research. Other elements, such as code or a publication, have their own lifecycle and workflow which needs to be in the plan.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Include Open Terminology and Concepts'>
    <p>Plans that are successful typically include clear terminology about how information is made findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. This can include licenses, repositories, formats, and governance of the project.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Plan for Preservation'>
    <p>Research materials are valuable and reusable long after the project's financial support ends. Reuse can extend beyond our own lifetimes. Therefore, researchers must arrange steps for preservation and accessibility to ensure work is not lost after a research interaction ends.</p>
  </Definition>
</Definitions>

## Designing for Openness

### Open Science Applies to the Entire Workﬂow

<SingleFigure size='full' src="./images/clone/Module_1/image402.jpg" caption={"Image credit: NASA\nOpen Science Workflow Phases Source: Opensciency."}/>

Regardless of your science discipline or the methodology that you use, the workflow remains relatively the same. It has a planning phase, an implementation phase, and a release phase. Within these phases, there are milestones that vary depending on the workflow you follow. For the purpose of our discussion in this lesson and the other modules in the curriculum, we have adopted the scientific workflow with general milestones described in the [Opensciency](https://opensciency.github.io/sprint-content/) (external link) curriculum. The details in your workflow may vary, but the overall concepts are the same. What is relevant here is that when adopting open science, it permeates all phases of the workflow. You prepare for it in the planning phase but then continue to integrate the principles of it throughout the implementation and release phases.

Products created throughout the scientific process are needed to enable others to reproduce the findings. Researchers who wish to make their results reproducible must make key elements of their study openly available for others to test.

<SingleFigure size='full' src="./images/clone/Module_1/image130.jpg" caption={"Image credit: NASA\nOpen Science Workflow Products Source: Opensciency."}/>

Continuing through the workflow, this updated diagram now shows the types of scientific products that are created at each milestone. The specialized products that you create may vary or be completely different, but the focus on discovery for the public remains the same. Any type of products you create can be modified to support the principles and concepts of open science. Where and how to integrate open science concepts into your products is the purpose of this Open Science 101 curriculum.

### Use, Make, Share

<SingleFigure size='medium' src="./images/clone/Module_1/image165.png" caption="Image credit: NASA"/>

The idea that open science can impact your entire scientific workflow may seem overwhelming and unachievable, but remember, open science occurs across a spectrum - even small steps towards openness can lead to more accessible, transparent, and reproducible science. The Open Science 101 curriculum is here to help lead you through this process.

In this section, we introduce the "Use, Make, Share" framework, which can start to gradually increase your adoption of open science depending on the nature and scope of your project. Throughout the course, we will explore how this framework can be used to make your science more open.

### What Resources Will You Use?

There are already many open science resources for you to use! Open science already has a long history. For example, the act that created NASA itself mandated sharing of its discoveries with all of humanity. Additionally, NASA has been sharing its data openly on the internet since the 1980s. Now, there are already over 100 petabytes of openly-available NASA data for you to search, download, and use. Examples of these services are later provided in Module 3. Technology and practices have been developed around code, making it easy to collaborate on building complex solutions - further examples are given in Module 4. A range of services make it easy to share and discover open access publications, which will be discussed in Module 5.

In Module 2, we will introduce you to some of the tools that not only make open science possible, but also easy.

### What Outputs Will You Make?

Throughout the research process, there will be different products and results produced. These range from data sets, samples, code, reports, manuscripts, conference proceedings, blog posts, and videos. Each of these have different considerations about how to make them, including how they can be made in open and collaborative ways.

There are also different ways to run a scientific project. Is your project going to be open from inception or open at publication? There are valid reasons for both approaches, but generally the earlier you are open with data, code, and results, the more opportunities there are to grow collaboration networks and build with others (which is quite fun). Often, researchers choose to be open within their project teams during development - exchanging data, code, and results - but then only share with the world once they feel they have a result they can trust. While this approach has been the cultural "norm" within many communities, this is changing as groups grow more comfortable with openness earlier in projects, experiencing valuable contributions from others and building new collaboration networks.

Modules 3, 4, and 5 will discuss how to make your data, code, and results open.

### How Will You Share?

<SingleFigure size='large' src="./images/clone/Module_1/image257.png" caption={<span>Image credit: Designed by NASA with use of graphics designed by <a href="https://www.freepik.com/">Freepik</a> (external link)</span>} link="https://www.freepik.com/" external={true} />

Where you choose to share your research materials and results will have a large influence on its impact - how easy it is for others to find it, how long it is available, and how easy it is to reuse.

Will you share data in a file filled with columns of unlabeled numbers without any units or explanations, or will it be in an open, standard format that follows the [Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (external link)? Module 3 has more details to help you better understand how to share your data and explains ideas like FAIR and the best practices in sharing data. This includes different considerations for where to share your data as well so that it is both accessible and preserved.

For code and software, since it is often updated and changed, many researchers first share it on a version control platform like GitHub or GitLab but then archive a version of it in a repository that has long-term preservation capabilities - more on this in Module 4!

For results, open access publications and preprint servers are common locations to share. Module 5 discusses all these options.

### Activity 5.1: Use, Make, Share

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_1/lightbulb.png" caption="Image credit: NASA"/>

Take a moment to answer the following questions on your current research or on research that you would like to do:

- What data, code, or publications do you currently use or would like to use? Are they open or closed?
- What are the tools and processes that you currently use? Is it easy to include others in collaboration?
- How is your work shared or planned to be shared? Can anyone access your results?

## Case Study: The Outcomes of an Open Plan

<QuoteImage quote="NASA's open science guiding principles are centered in our Early Release Science work, supporting a transparent and collaborative scientific process." byWho="Co-author Dr. Natasha Batalha" bgImage="./images/clone/Module_1/natashaquote.jpg" caption={<span>Image credit: Modified by NASA from <em>Unrecognizable chemist taking liquid with pipette from test tube in modern laboratory</em> by RF.<em>.studio</em> via <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a> (external link)</span>} captionLink="https://www.pexels.com/" captionExternal={true}/>

One of the first discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
was [the first detection of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere of a planet orbiting another star](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2022/nasa-s-webb-detects-carbon-dioxide-in-exoplanet-atmosphere). This discovery was enabled through the open science principles adopted both by the project and the team.

<SingleFigure size='medium' src="./images/clone/Module_1/atmocomp.jpg" caption="Figure Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, Joseph Olmsted (STScI)"/>

This was conducted as part of the JWST's Early Release Science (ERS) Program as part of the JWST ERS Exoplanet Transiting Community program (ERS-TRANSIT). This was some of the earliest science data taken by the JWST that was made openly available. However, the team began their work years before the observations and included open science into every step of the process. The team worked in an open format from ideation to analysis, and through to publication and communication.

Let's walk through and see what open results were in fact produced. While doing so, let's take a look at what the advantages of doing so at each stage were.

One of the most important parts of starting a project is thinking about who is going to be involved. How will the team function? Before samples are collected, before data is downloaded, before code is written, ask yourself: how will you all work together? What are the roles and responsibilities of each team member? How and when will you share any materials? Those were key parts that the JWST project got right.


The initial team, during the planning phase, developed and openly published information in the form of the [code of conduct](https://ers-transit.github.io/code-of-conduct.html) (external link) and the [publication policy](https://ers-transit.github.io/documents/publication-policy-v1.0.pdf) (external link).

Basically, they welcomeed others to work with them, but listed out clear rules. Then, the lead scientists regularly talked about these expectations with the team - especially as it expanded - so that everyone knew what was expected of them and what they got in return (credit).

The outcome and benefit of publishing this information was the addition of new members to the team, as well as an agreed-to and established collaborative philosophy among the team.

The team grew to almost 400 people, all working together, all knowing what to expect. This created trust.

</Table>

JWST data is complicated, and it needs processing and data pipelines. The precision needed to achieve this type of detection requires detailed analysis of the observations and a wide range of expertise.

During the implementation phase, the team collaborated on creating the data processing software together so that everyone would benefit. Imagine the wasted effort if all 400 people had written the software themselves. The benefit and outcome was that by collaborating on this effort, the team decreased duplicative efforts, collaborators got credit for their work, the software was more accurate, and this effort accelerated the data wrangling process. The resulting software, [Eureka!](https://github.com/kevin218/Eureka) (external link), was created openly with [documentation](https://eurekadocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (external link) and published with [peer review of the software package](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.04503) (external link).

But they didn't have to start from scratch! The ERS-TRANSIT team was able to build on the work of others. Eureka! was built on the [JWST pipeline software](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst) (external link), developed openly by the JWST mission team. Furthermore, they were able to build on a much larger open source software ecosystem using Python and Astropy.

### Open Access to Results

</Table>

During the release phase, the team labeled research products adequately for reuse and reproducibility, later publishing them in public forums/repositories. The outcome and benefits included collaborators receiving credit for data, code, software, and other digital research products that benefited the scientific community. Data, code, and software were archived openly on the general data repository [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/ers-transit) (external link), while the publication was made available as a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11692) (external link) and an [open access publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05269-w) (external link).

Making your results open also opens you up to clearer ways of receiving credit, reducing the risk of scooping (each result can be individually referenced as soon as it is made available). Applying reproducibility practices separately on different parts of the project such as preparation documents, datasets, code, software, and reporting allows other researchers to test and reuse your work in their research. As a result, your research will be cited more often, thus bringing fair recognition for your work. Collaborators can be more motivated to contribute because they can easily get recognition in terms of authorship for their contributions made for each one of the research outputs generated.

## Steps to Continue Your Open Science Journey

Here, we will explore the next steps to open science that everybody can take. The thought that open science can impact your entire scientific workflow may seem overwhelming and unachievable, but this is not the case. You can start slowly and gradually increase your adoption depending on the nature and scope of your project. Here are a few immediate ways that you can start engaging in open science.

### Where to Go From Here

- Get involved! Become part of an open science community in your sector.
- Start using and/or sharing the open science tools of your community.
- Learn how to use and archive data in repositories, community tools, and resources.
- In summary: Find, collaborate, and share!

### Identify Your Open Science Communities

Here are the steps you can take to find your own open science community:

- Talk with your colleagues.
- Read your field's literature.
- Run searches, in general and discipline-specific areas.
- Investigate online communities encouraging open science, such as:
  - The EU's ["Foster Open Science"](https://openscience.eu/article/project/foster) (external link) program 
  - [The Turing Way online manual](https://book.the-turing-way.org/)  (external link)
  -  [FORRT](https://forrt.org/) (external link)

Join open science communities! There are generic ones listed here, or you can seek out communities that are not only within your domain but also within your geographical area.

- Open Science Framework's [discussion board](https://groups.google.com/g/openscienceframework?pli=1) (external link).
- Opensciency online open science [community list](https://opensciency.github.io/sprint-content/open-tools-resources/lesson5-open-science-communities.html#communities-of-practice-list) (external link).

### Explore Open Repositories

There are many repositories that host open data, code, and results. We share many of these resources in the later modules, but here are two NASA repositories that allow you to search for existing data collections that might be relevant to your interests:

- [Science Discovery Engine](http://science.data.nasa.gov/search)
- [https://data.nasa.gov/](https://data.nasa.gov/)

### Three Steps to Open Science that Anyone Can Take

1. Keep seeking best practices for open science and develop plans to be more open in your science or research.
2. Think about all the different types of reviews you are involved with, and how to improve them with a goal of openness.
3. Ask colleagues about open science activities and award credit for them in evaluations.

### Continue Taking Open Science 101

<SingleFigure size='medium' src="./images/clone/Module_1/lightbulb-ethos-of-open-science.png" caption="Image credit: NASA"/>

The Open Science 101 curriculum is a good place to go for a more in-depth introduction to the various elements of open science - each of the next four modules provides details and practical exercises to help participants develop a better understanding of that specific topic.

#### Disclaimer

Please note that we reference several papers throughout the course and depending on the paper it might be blocked by a paywall. If you would like to get a copy of the paper, please contact the author or search for it in an online preprint archive. For example, [bioRxiv.org](http://biorxiv.org/) (external link).

## Lesson 5: Summary

There is no one way of doing open science, and any steps you take to make your science more open are extremely valuable, especially as we transition to a more open scientific ecosystem in the future. We want people to be able to identify the most important things they "can" openly share, but with the ultimate goal of complete openness.

### What Have We Covered in this Module?

- Preparing and organizing in advance are crucial components for ensuring the effectiveness of open science work.
- Open Science and Data Management Plans (OSDMP) provide a plan for how open science is integrated into a project, including the sharing of data, code, and results.
- Designing for openness is a critical aspect of making sure that open science is integrated into the entire scientific workflow from start to finish. This includes resources that can be used, products that will be made, and how the science will be shared.
- Open science is already happening - there are already teams conducting their research openly and many resources that can be used to make your research more open.
- There are more opportunities to participate and learn about open science - this is just the start!
