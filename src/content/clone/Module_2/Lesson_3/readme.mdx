# Lesson 3: Tools for Open Data

## Overview

This lesson will go over the concepts, considerations, and tools for making data and results open. By taking a closer look at the FAIR Principles, you'll learn how to validate and reproduce open data. You'll also be introduced to plans, tools, data formats, and other considerations related to making data and sharing the results. Additionally, this lesson will give examples of repositories and communities for open data. Knowing these concepts and tools will make it easier for you to make your own research accessible and reusable.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:

- Define the different types of scientific data.
- Define what the acronym "FAIR" means and explain how it supports the sharing of open data.
- Identify data management practices and tools to locate data in repositories.
- List and explain the resources commonly used in making data, including formatting, inspecting, and assessing the "FAIR"-ness of data.

## Introduction to Open Data

Data is a major part of scientific research, and why wouldn't it be? It informs tools that we use, stories that we read, and decisions that we make on a daily basis.

For instance, the open access [Copernicus Emergency Management Service](https://emergency.copernicus.eu/) (external link) implemented by the European Commission produces open access data 24/7, which is collected by ESA and NASA satellites to produce maps that inform disaster preparedness and response efforts across the globe. This is only one example among many others demonstrating the value of data - particularly open and public data - in our daily life and for public good.

Data shared openly in scientific research brings tremendous value to the scientific community and beyond, from small, isolated communities to urban populations. Before understanding the broad-based impact of data, let's first look at what is data in the context of scientific research. Specifically, we will discuss the definition and characteristics of open data.

### What is Data?

Scientific data is any type of information that is collected, observed, or created in the context of research. It can be:

- Primary - Raw from measurements or instruments.
- Secondary - Processed from secondary analysis and interpretations.
- Published - Final format available for use and reuse.
- Metadata - Data about your data.

It is everything that you need to validate or reproduce your research findings, as well as what is required for the understanding and handling of the data.

The following sections discuss ways to ensure that data is fully utilized and made available to the most amount of people. These best practices center around community frameworks and tools that help researchers manage and share open data.

## FAIR Principles

<SingleFigure size='full' src="./images/clone/Module_2/image28.png" caption="Image Credit: NASA"/>

Just like driving on a road, if everyone follows agreed-upon rules, everything will go much smoother. The rules don't need to be exactly the same for every region, but they share common practices based on insights about safety and efficiency.

For example, maybe you drive on the left side of the road or the right side. Either is fine, those sort of details are for different communities to decide on. However, there are overarching guidelines shared by communities across the globe, such as driving on the road instead of the sidewalk, using a turn signal when appropriate, adhering to lights at intersections that direct traffic, and following speed limits. Some communities may implement stricter rules than others, or practice them differently, but these guidelines help everyone move around safely through a common understanding of how to drive on roads. For scientific data, these guidelines, published in 2016 by Wilkinson et al., are called the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable or “FAIR” Principles. They do to data what their title suggests. That is, these principles make it possible for others (and yourself) to find, get, understand, and use data correctly.

(Wilkinson et al., 2016)

These are high-level guidelines, and much like open science, implementation is nuanced. Sometimes it takes a group effort and/or a long production process/funding to make data and results FAIR. For other datasets, it could be more straightforward. A well-coordinated data management plan is needed for full compliance with FAIR, and the details of this will be discussed further in Module 3, "Open Data."

## Tools to Help with Planning For Open Data Creation

### Data Management Plan

The previous lesson describes the requirements of a data management plan (DMP). Below are two open science resources to get you started on creating a data management plan:

<CustomTabs>
    <Tab eventKey="one" title="DMPTool">
        <p>The <a href="https://dmptool.org/">DMPTool</a> (external link) in the United States helps researchers by featuring a template that lists a funder's requirements for specific directorate requests for proposals (RFPs). The DMPTool also publishes other open DMPs from funded projects that can be referenced to improve your own. For example, the Research Data Management Organizer (RDMO) enables German institutions as well as researchers to plan and carry out their management of research data.</p>
    </Tab>
    <Tab eventKey="two" title="ARGOS">
        <p><a href="https://argos.openaire.eu/home">ARGOS</a> (external link) is used to plan Research Data Management activities of European and nationally-funded projects (e.g. Horizon Europe, CHIST-ERA, the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology - FCT). ARGOS produces and publishes FAIR and machine-actionable DMPs that contain links to other outputs (e.g. publications-data-software), and minimizes the effort to create DMPs from scratch by introducing automations in the writing process. OpenAIRE provides a guide on how to create DMP.</p>
    </Tab>
</CustomTabs>

### Data Repositories

A data repository is a digital space to house, curate, and share research outputs. Data repositories were originally used to support the needs of research communities. Examples of data repositories include:

- [**NASA's Space Physics Data Facility**](https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/) is the permanent archive for NASA's space physics data from present and past missions.
- [**NASA's Heliophysics Digital Resource Library**](https://hdrl.gsfc.nasa.gov/) provides open-access gateways to thousands of datasets from current and historic NASA heliophysics missions.
- [**NASA's High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC)**](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/) is the primary archive for NASA's (and other space agencies') missions studying electromagnetic radiation from extremely energetic cosmic phenomena. It contains data obtained by high-energy astronomy missions, as well as data from space missions, balloons, and ground-based facilities.
- [**NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS)**](https://pds.nasa.gov/) is a long-term archive of digital data products returned from NASA's planetary missions and other flight and ground-based data acquisitions, including laboratory experiments.
- [**NASA's Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center**](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/centers/sedac-daac) focuses on archiving and distributing data related to human interactions in the environment.
- [**RCSB Protein Data Bank**](https://www.rcsb.org/) (external link) uses a data repository to catalog 3-D structures of proteins and nucleic acids.
- [**Genbank**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) (external link) of the National Institutes of Health uses a genetic sequence database that contains annotated, publicly-available nucleic acid sequences.
- [**The Image Data Resource**](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/) (external link) is a public repository of microscopy bio-image datasets from published studies.
- [**The Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive**](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/) (external link) is a public resource for raw cryo-EM images.
- [**OpenNeuro**](https://openneuro.org/) (external link) is an open platform for validating and sharing brain imaging data. The tools featured in Open Neuro enable easy access, search, and analysis of annotated datasets.

Open science tools such as data repositories should implement FAIR principles, especially in the case of attribution of persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI), metadata annotation, and machine-readability.

Additional examples of data repositories and other open science tools include but are not limited to:

<Definitions>
  <Definition title='ZENODO'>
    <p><a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a> (external link) is an example of a data repository that allows the upload of research data and creates DOIs. Its popularity among the research community is due to its simplified interface, support of community curation, and feature that enables researchers to deposit various types of research outputs, from datasets and reports to publications, software, and multimedia content.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='DATAVERSE'>
    <p><a href="https://dataverse.org/">The Dataverse Project</a> (external link) is an open source online application to share, preserve, cite, explore, and analyze research data, available to researchers of all disciplines worldwide for free.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='DRYAD'>
    <p><a href="https://datadryad.org/">The Dryad Digital Repository</a> (external link) is a curated online resource that makes research data discoverable, freely reusable, and citable. Unlike previously mentioned tools, it operates on a membership scheme for organizations such as research institutions and publishers.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='DATACITE'>
    <p><a href="https://datacite.org/">Datacite</a> (external link) is a global non-profit organization that provides DOIs for research data and other research outputs on a membership basis.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='OSF'>
    <p><a href="https://osf.io/">The Open Science Framework</a> (external link) is an open source platform for sharing, managing, and collaborating research.</p>
  </Definition>
</Definitions>

Data services and resources for supporting research require robust infrastructure, which itself relies on collaboration. The [EUDAT Collaborative Data Infrastructure](https://www.eudat.eu/) (external link), a sustained network of more than twenty European research organizations, is an example of an initiative to collaborate on the infrastructures of data services.

Private companies also host and maintain online tools for sharing research data and files. For example, Figshare is one example of a free and open access service operated by private companies. It provides DOIs for all types of files and recently developed a restricted publishing model to accommodate intellectual property (IP) rights requirements. It allows sharing the outputs only within a customized Figshare group (e.g. your research team) or with users in a specific IP range. Additional advances include integration with code repositories, such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

Additional research data repositories can be found in the publicly-available [ Registry of Research Data Repositories](https://www.re3data.org/) (external link).  [OpenAire](https://explore.openaire.eu/search/find/dataproviders) (external link), a hosted search engine, also provides a powerful search function of data and repositories. It features a filter for country, type, and thematic area, as well as enables the download of data.

The amount of data, repositories, and different policies can be overwhelming. If you have trouble determining which repository is right for you, consult librarians, data managers, and/or data stewards in your institution, or check within your discipline-specific or other community of practice.

### Activity 3.1: Explore Zenodo and Sign Up!

Explore open repositories to familiarize yourself with their structure and available product information. The most popular repository at the moment is Zenodo. Review the following 4.5-minute video to get an overview of Zenodo and then sign up for an account. You can use your ORCID account to sign up if you have one or made one in the previous lesson.

## Tools to Help with Using and Making Open Data

### Data Formats

A useful file format can be read into memory by some software. Think of the format as a tool for making data accessible. Easy to use formats feature:

- A simple, easy-to-understand structure.
- A clear and open specification for the format that is ideally not tied to a specific software product.
- Open software libraries and APIs that can parse the format.

The formats that are considered the most interoperable against the criteria above include Comma Separated Values (CSV), Extensible Markup Language (XML), and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). Other common formats for researchers include binary array-based formats like Network Common Data Form (NetCDF), Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), Geotiff, Flexible Image Transport System (FITS), and other formats designed for cloud storage and access like [Zarr](https://zarr.dev/) (external link), [Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF](https://www.cogeo.org/) (external link), and [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) (external link). Many of these formats have tools that check datasets for compliance and readability.

### Inspecting Data

Modern data formats allow the storage of much more than mere data points. Once one adopts these standards (e.g. NetCDF), the discovery of the contents on each file can be aided by a variety of tools which together help map primary data and/or display the associated metadata. Several tools exist for inspecting data, too numerous for all to be mentioned here. Notable tools to start with include:

<CustomTabs>
    <Tab eventKey="one" title="CSV, XML, JSON">
      <p>These files can all be opened with most common text editors. There are some tools that can create views of the files that are more user-friendly, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>csv: Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.</li>
        <li>xml: Most internet browsers and with any text editor like Notepad or Microsoft Word or Google Docs.</li>

      </ul>
    </Tab>
    <Tab eventKey="two" title="NetCDF, HDF, FITS">
      <p>These files require special software tools to view their contents. Many of these tools will also visualize the data as well.</p>
