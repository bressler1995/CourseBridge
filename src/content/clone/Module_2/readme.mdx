## About This Module

This module is designed to help you get started on practicing open science, offering an introduction to the ideas and resources that are fundamental to this journey. There are many defining methods and models that bridge the concepts and practice of open science. For example, the "Use, Make, Share" framework was constructed to help you immediately assign purpose to the concepts and tools that will be covered in this module as well as in the entire Open Science 101 curriculum. All of the information that you learn here will be addressed in more detail as you participate in other modules, but it can also be applied immediately after completing this module.

### Module Learning Objectives

- Define the foundational elements of open science, which includes research products, the "Use, Make, Share" framework, and the role of an Open Science and Data Management Plan (OSDMP).
- List and explain the purpose of resources used to discover and assess research products for reuse, including repositories, search portals, publications, documentation (e.g. README files), metadata, and licensing.
- Develop a high-level strategy for making and sharing data that employs the FAIR Principles, incorporates a data management plan, tracks data and authors with persistent identifiers and citations, and utilizes the appropriate data formats and tools for making data and sharing results.
- Describe the software lifecycle and design a high-level strategy for making and sharing software that considers the use of a software management plan, the tools needed for development including source code, kernels, programming languages, third-party software and version control, and the tools and documentation used for publishing and curating open software.
- List the resources for sharing research products including preprints, open access publications, reference management systems, and resources to support reproducibility.

## Key Terms

<Definitions>
    <Definition title='Virtual Machine'>
        <p>A computing environment that replicates the functionality of a physical machine but at a higher level of abstraction on a computer. This allows the specified virtual machine's resources to be more flexible and compartmentalized.</p>
    </Definition>
    <Definition title='Metadata'>
        <p>Information about the data that provides additional details and context.</p>
    </Definition>
    <Definition title='Data Repository'>
        <p>An enterprise data storage entity (or sometimes entities) into which data has been specifically partitioned for an analytical or reporting purpose.</p>
    </Definition>
    <Definition title='Computing Environment'>
        <p>A platform that provides necessary software dependencies, a development area, and connections to computational resources to facilitate running code.</p>
    </Definition>
    <Definition title='ORCID iD'>
        <p>A numeric code used to uniquely identify authors and contributors of scholarly communication. Researchers provide an ORCID iD for publications and association memberships. ORCID is an international, interdisciplinary, open, non-proprietary, and not-for-profit organization created by the research community for the benefit of all stakeholders and the organizations that support the research ecosystem.</p>
    </Definition>
    <Definition title='Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)'>
        <p>A long-lasting digital reference to an entity.</p>
    </Definition>
    <Definition title='Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)'>
        <p>A string of characters standardized by the International Organization for Standardization, assigned to a piece of digital content, that points to the digital location of the content.</p>
    </Definition>
