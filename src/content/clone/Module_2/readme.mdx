## About This Module

This module is designed to help you get started with digital learning practices, offering an introduction to the ideas and resources that are fundamental to this journey. There are many defining methods and approaches that bridge the concepts and practice of digital learning. For example, the "Learn, Create, Share" framework was constructed to help you immediately assign purpose to the concepts and tools that will be covered in this module as well as in the entire curriculum. All of the information that you learn here will be addressed in more detail as you progress through other modules, but it can also be applied immediately after completing this module.

### Module Learning Objectives

- Define the foundational elements of digital learning, which includes educational resources, the "Learn, Create, Share" framework, and the role of a Learning Resource Management Plan (LRMP).
- List and explain the purpose of resources used to discover and assess learning materials for reuse, including repositories, search portals, publications, documentation (e.g. README files), descriptive information, and licensing.
- Develop a high-level strategy for creating and sharing resources that employs accessibility principles, incorporates a resource management plan, tracks materials and creators with unique identifiers and citations, and utilizes the appropriate formats and tools for creating and sharing educational content.
- Describe the content development lifecycle and design a high-level strategy for creating and sharing resources that considers the use of a content management plan, the tools needed for development including source materials, frameworks, languages, third-party resources and version control, and the tools and documentation used for publishing and maintaining open educational resources.
